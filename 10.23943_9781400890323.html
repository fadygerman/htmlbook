While I have sought to make my core contribution the promulgation of a new theory for how political identities are reinforced through authoritarian regime repression, a second narrative lurks just beneath the language of theories, hypotheses, and empirical tests. The “shadow” book is one about the everyday lived experience of individuals managing the high-stakes political world of autocratic Iraq during the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The qualitative stories embedded in this book appear as evidence for assumptions, empirical implications of hypotheses, and as tests for my theo- retical expectations. These narratives reflect the complex interactions between a regime and a citizenry, both struggling for survival. Some of the qualitative accounts are mundane, focused on the ways that Iraqis sought opportunities for social, educational, or political advancement. Other narrative accounts are more profound in their implications. In all cases, the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime’s aspi- rations for political hegemony were thwarted by a lumpiness in the regime’s ability to monitor its own society and, eventually, declining state capacity.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">When fiscal conditions were favorable—like during the 1970s after nation- alization of the oil industry—the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime managed emerging political threats with relative ease. The 1980s and 1990s, however, brought an entirely new set of challenges, first with the tremendously costly Iran-Iraq War and, later, with the humanitarian catastrophe of the international economic embargo. Understanding how the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime managed Iraqi politics during good economic times is not as puzzling as comprehending how the regime managed domestic threats during tough times. The burdens associated with war and sanctions increased individual acts of political non-compliance. A primary argument of this book is that the way citizens were punished in response to these behaviors forged and reinforced meaningful, actionable forms of political identity.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Communities that were culturally distant from the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime were difficult to penetrate from a monitoring and intelligence-gathering perspec- tive. When the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists could not accurately distinguish between those indi- viduals who had complied with and those who had resisted regime dictates, punishment was meted out imprecisely. In other words, the regime meted out punishment based on the precision of its intelligence. Communities that were culturally distant from the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists presented a monitoring challenge and group-level punishment reinforced the salience of group identities. Highly penetrated communities that were culturally close to the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists were pun- ished with a high degree of accuracy; the result was political atomization for members of those communities.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The struggle to make the Iraqi population legible to the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists was a core regime pursuit. While countries across the Middle East were seeking to stem growing urbanization and the associated expansion of urban slums, the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists were clearing the Kurdish countryside, moving tens of thousands of Iraqi Kurds into cities to increase the regime’s ability to monitor and penetrate northern society. One of the richest sources of data used in this project emerges as a response to the regime’s failure to accurately “read” Iraqi society. Prior to the regime-shaking 1991 Uprisings, the regime collected only basic data about Iraqi high school students, like name, address, and political orientation. After 1991, however, the regime significantly expanded infor- mation collection with the goal of identifying which young people and, by association, which families were politically trustworthy. In both the example of the creation of Kurdish urban settlements and the enhanced informa- tion collection on high school students, separating out “good” from “bad” citizens was a preoccupation of the regime. The documents that comprise the empirical content of this project are themselves a manifestation of the bureaucratization of autocracy that the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime epitomizes.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">How does the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime in Iraq compare to other authoritarian regimes? And how broadly might the lessons of this book be applied? The idea that group-level punishment reinforces communal identity has wide applicability. In the democratic context, there are countless examples of cases where governments or local authorities criminalize entire communities because investigators did not possess or invest in the capacity to differentiate between law-abiding residents from law breakers. During World War II, Japanese Americans were less legible to the US government than German and Italian Americans; as a result Japanese Americans were collectively imprisoned</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">preface <span class="s17">• </span>xv</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">based on their ethnic identity, while German and Italian Americans were investigated individually, with subsequent implications for the development of a Japanese American cultural identity.<span class="s19">1 </span>In the runup to the 1984 Olympic games in Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Police Department engaged in wide- spread sweeps of areas of South-Central Los Angeles in a bid to crack down on gang violence. Thousands of young people were arrested as part of “Operation Hammer,” the overwhelming majority of whom were never charged with a crime.<span class="s19">2 </span>My arguments suggest that a shared sense of salient identity would emerge among residents of South-Central Los Angeles as a result of the way the area was repressed by a state that could not effectively discriminate among individual actors within that population. This period of collective repression spawned new forms of anti-system artistic expression, and in 1992 South- Central Los Angeles was the epicenter for major ethnic riots.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">While my arguments might be applied to democratic contexts, the theo- retical implications of the book are particularly apt for the study of political behavior in autocracies. In countries where a dictator rules a homogeneous population that is culturally similar to the ruling clique, effective monitoring of the population means citizens are constantly worried about members of their own social network who may inform on them. The result is a relatively low degree of interpersonal trust between individuals and no reinforcement of a salient identity around which political mobilization might organize. For example, North Korea is a relatively homogenous society where the ruling elite comes from the majority cultural group. There are few barriers to intelligence gathering within the population and the regime has the capability to mete out punishment with precision.

What explains the use of repression and the deployment of state violence? And how does repression impact citizenries? There is a dearth of scholarship on these subjects relative to studies focused on either interstate conflict or political patronage. This book is the product of my efforts to dig a little deeper into the causes and consequences of repression as well as to understand how repression fits into a broader conceptualization of power in autocratic regimes.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 241pt;text-indent: 31pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: right;">Lisa Blaydes Stanford, CA <i>September 24, 2017</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: left;">Davenport 2007.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: left;">Davenport 2015, 9.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: left;">Rummel 1997.</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark5">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS </a><a name="bookmark6">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">There is virtually no end to the debts that I have incurred while writing this book. My first thanks go to the Hoover Institution, which brought the Iraq Memory Foundation collection to Stanford University and supported my research on the materials as a National Fellow during the 2012–2013 academic year. It was during that year that I was able to put together many of the datasets that form the empirical core of this project. Richard Sousa, former director of the Library and Archives at the Hoover Institution, and Eric Wakin, current director, have been important sources of support for my scholarship. At Hoover, Carol Leadenham was always helpful in the reading room, and Haidar Hadi has been a lifeline for me as I have sought to navigate the collection and understand more about Iraqi society. The Iraq Memory Foundation has its roots in the tireless work of Kanan Makiya, without whom the materials would never have been preserved and digitized for research.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The archivists at University of Colorado’s Norlin Library were both kind and welcoming. Many thanks to David Hays and Bruce Montgomery for facilitating my work on the Iraqi Secret Police files. David Palkki and the staff of the now-closed Conflict Records Research Center assisted with my access to the Saddam Hussein Collection at National Defense University. Michael Brill and Abby Fanlo helped me to fill in gaps in my research following my visit there.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A number of institutions and programs provided me with various forms of research support. The Institute for Research in the Social Sciences at Stanford offered me initial seed funding for the project. The Smith Richardson Foundation generously extended a Junior Faculty Research Grant. The staff at the Monterey Institute of International Studies arranged a course of study in Iraqi Arabic that was extremely valuable.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The Stanford Summer Research College was critical for the completion of this project. Between 2010 and 2016, more than a dozen outstanding</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">xviii <span class="s17">• </span>acknowledgments</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">undergraduate student researchers assisted me with various aspects of this project,  from  data  collection  to coding  variables  and  reviewing  various literatures. I am grateful to each of them for their cheerful attitudes and willingness to dedicate a part of their summer to working with me on this project. I am also appreciative of students associated with the Stanford Inter- national Policy Studies Program for their kind assistance.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Much of this book was written while I was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behaviorial Sciences. Many thanks to Margaret Levi for her mentorship and encouragement. I am also thankful to Mary Murphy, who generously shared her knowledge of social psychology with me at a critical juncture in my writing.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The Stanford Department of Political Science has been an ever-reliable source of intellectual inspiration and feedback. David Laitin continues to be the most helpful of colleagues. Gary Cox and Lachlan McNamee generously read and provided important feedback on chapters. Jim Fearon, Steve Krasner, Yuki Takagi, and Barry Weingast talked me through difficult puzzles. I am grateful to each of them.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford’s Free- man Spogli Institute hosted a book conference for me with funding from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Martha Crenshaw convened an outstanding group of colleagues who gave me a clear sense of direction for how to move forward with my manuscript. Many thanks to Barbara Geddes, Anna Gryzmala-Busse, Beatriz Magaloni, Neil Narang, Christiana Parreira, David Patel, Scott Sagan, Ken Schultz, and Jeremy Weinstein for their participation and helpful advice.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Kind audiences at a number of universities provided me with feedback and guidance.

Among the many useful comments I received, some interventions stand out in my memory. John Ferejohn encouraged me to think more carefully about the assumptions underlying my project. Paul Staniland challenged me to state my claims more boldly. Jim Robinson pushed me to think more carefully about the implications of my work for the study of state failure. Laia Balcells, Carles Boix, Fotini Christia, Dan Corstange, Clark Gibson, Kevan Harris,</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 179pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">acknowledgments <span class="s17">• </span>xix</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Sam Helfont, Amaney Jamal, Lewis Kornhauser, Steve Kotkin, Timur Kuran, Gerry Munck, Sebastian Schutte and Victor Shih all offered intellectual support and encouragement.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Tareq al-Samman and Sarah Ghattas were research assistants without par- allel. During the time he worked with me on this book, Tareq and I watched his native Syria descend into civil war. I learned much from our conversations, about life in authoritarian Syria but also about the pursuit of economic justice, Tareq’s passion. I also have Tareq to thank for designing the maps that appear in this book. Sarah was a model research assistant, responding kindly and patiently to my requests for information. While working together, we shared many conversations about her native Egypt during the tumultuous months after the 2011 Uprisings. Sarah also generously shared her knowledge about social practices within Egypt’s Coptic Christian community, insights that were important for other aspects of my research.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">I was fortunate to have had Alissa Walter proofread the manuscript and assist with the transliteration and indexing. Omar Shakir graciously provided me with introductions to members of the Iraqi community in the San Diego area who shared critical insights. Eliana Vasquez provided outstanding faculty support throughout research and writing.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Many thanks to Eric Crahan at Princeton University Press for his enthusi- asm for the project. He has been a thoughtful and supportive editor. I am also appreciative of Karen Verde for her careful copyediting and Leslie Grundfest for assistance with the book’s production.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">My family provided the loving support and patience I needed to finish this project. My exceptionally kind brother, Bernard, read and edited portions of the manuscript. My children, Jonah and Ethan, are endless sources of joy for me. My greatest debt goes to my husband, Josh, whose reliable support helped me at every step along the way. It is to Josh that this book is dedicated. Infer nothing about him from the fact that I have dedicated to him a book about repression, as he exemplifies the opposite.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">STATE  OF REPRESSION</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark7">C H A P T E R 1</a><a name="bookmark8">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">INTRODUCTION</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Citizens of few countries have experienced a recent political history as calami- tous as that suffered by Iraqis. In the 1970s, Iraq was a middle-income country with a significant and growing class of educated and cosmopolitan elites. Endowed with both oil and water resources, Iraq was on a path to economic modernization, particularly in the years following the 1973 surge in the price of petroleum. Increasing Iraqi oil rents paralleled the rise of an ambitious, yet ruthless, political leader, and the relative prosperity of the 1970s was disrupted by war and repression. The pain of political oppression was compounded by crippling economic sanctions followed by foreign occupation and the violent unfolding of a sectarian civil war. During this time, Iraq became a destination and breeding ground for Islamic extremists.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The Iraqi state that emerged from this trauma has struggled to reestablish territorial integrity. Its governance structures are fragile and prone to sectarian favoritism. In 2006, then-Senator Joseph Biden suggested that an Iraq of autonomous regions split along ethnic lines might bring an end to the civil war.<span class="s19">1 </span>More than ten years later, US policymakers continue to debate whether a unified Iraq will ever again be governable.<span class="s19">2 </span>This project explores the condi- tions that led to the breakdown of the Iraqi state through an examination of Iraqi political life during Saddam Hussein’s time in power.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">There is little doubt that the recent history of political trauma Iraq has experienced has its roots in the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party’s governance.

The internal workings of a dictatorship are often described as taking place within a “black box”—while some of the input and output characteristics are known, the inner dynamics of how power coalesces and is maintained remains opaque. And because collecting information in a nondemocratic setting is so challenging, relatively little scholarship has sought to explain the mechanics of autocratic control in the world’s most repressive regimes. It is virtually impossible to study the internal politics of such regimes while the dictator is in power.<span class="s19">3 </span>Even after regimes have been overthrown, new holders of political power may have an incentive to hide information about the repressive and control apparatuses due to the political implications of exposing the often widespread nature of societal complic- ity with the ancien régime.<span class="s19">4 </span>And although the existing literature on non- democracies has grown tremendously in the last twenty years, it tends to be sparse when compared to scholarly work that seeks to explain political life in democracies.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Despite these barriers, determining the specificities of everyday political life in Iraq during the Saddam Hussein era has become possible as a result of the recent availability of millions of documents recovered following two pivotal events—the establishment of Kurdish self-rule in northern Iraq in the wake of the 1991 Uprisings and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein’s Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime in 2003. The first cache of government documents was salvaged following large-scale popular demonstrations that took place following the Iraqi mil- itary withdrawal from Kuwait. This collection—known as the Iraqi Secret Police Files—is housed at the University of Colorado Boulder. These files provide detailed information about Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party and government operations in northern Iraq leading up to 1991.

The collection contained more than 1,000 individual documents comprising more than 30,000 pages and is described by the CRRC management team in Woods et al. (2011). The center was closed for budget reasons in June 2015.

The collection includes correspondence, reports, membership and personnel files, judicial and investigatory dossiers, and administrative files relating to political conditions in, and governance of, Iraq. Most documents are part of the Ba<span class="s21">c</span>th Regional Command Collection (BRCC). While there are files that are drawn from both the earlier and later periods of Ba<span class="s21">c</span>thist rule, the collection skews strongly toward the 1990s and early 2000s in terms of the sheer number of documents. There are a number of reasons why this may be the case, including the possible purging of older documents, the tendency for older documents to be lost or not to survive and the increasingly common use of computer technologies which</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">made it easier to produce documents (versus the use of handwriting and typewriters from the earlier periods).</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">Working with the Ba<span class="s21">c</span>th Party Records proved to be challenging, in part because of the</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">sheer size of the collection. I began my research on the collection initially by browsing through the documents to get a sense of their internal organization. The collection is formally divided into a series of discrete file groupings including the North Iraq dataset, the Kuwait dataset, the School Registers, the Ba<span class="s21">c</span>th Party Boxfiles, and the Membership dataset. The School Registers and the Ba<span class="s21">c</span>th Party Boxfiles make up the largest two groupings within the collection. The School Registers are organized by governorate-year. Within each governorate-year file, data are organized by school where each “sheet” within the Registers includes information on dozens of students. The Ba<span class="s21">c</span>th Party Boxfiles, while not organized in a straightforward geographic or temporal manner like the Registers, frequently exhibited forms of internal coherence within each electronic boxfile. For example, a boxfile typically included the contents of a binder or folder of materials. The first page of the electronic boxfile often includes a scan of the descriptive label that might appear on the outside of the binder. As a result, I was often able to scan the descriptive binder labels to identify boxfiles on topics of political significance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark9">Reliance on collections of Iraqi government documents no doubt allows for only a partial, incomplete picture of political life in Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Another important source of information comes from the first-hand testimony of Iraqis. Between 2003 and 2008, documentary film- makers associated with the Iraq Memory Foundation recorded the experi- ences of 190 individuals who lived through Ba</a><span class="s18">c</span>thist rule as part of an oral history project. These testimonials aired on <i>al-</i><span class="s18">c</span><i>Iraqiyya</i>—an Arabic-language satellite and terrestrial public television network in Iraq that serves 85 percent of the country’s population.<span class="s19">9 </span>I include the first-hand testimony of individuals interviewed for this project at various points in the book.<span class="s19">10</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Using data from these three collections, as well as material from a vast secondary source literature on Iraqi politics and history, I have sought answers to a series of foundational questions related to autocratic governance in Iraq. What did the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime actually know about its citizens? Why did it use blunt, seemingly suboptimal, forms of punishment against its population? And what explains variation in the types of compliance and resistance behaviors undertaken by Iraqis during Hussein’s dictatorship?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">While some of my findings affirm a conventional narrative about citizen behavior in autocratic Iraq, in other cases the archival evidence demands we update the accepted wisdom about Iraqi political life. I find that, despite pretensions to political hegemony, the Iraqi regime frequently lacked important information about its population, and this problem of intelligence gathering varied in magnitude across ethnic, religious, and communal groups within Iraq. When rebellious behaviors occurred, inadequate information about the specific identity of the perpetrators led the regime to engage in forms of collective punishment that reinforced and cemented identity cleavages</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">The testimonials, including material not included in the original television broadcasts, are available for viewing in the Library and Archives of the Hoover Institution.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">On the one hand, the individuals selected for participation in the oral history project were chosen because of their experiences with regime repression. Clearly not all Iraqis were subject to the type of abuses described in the footage. On the other hand, Saddam Hussein is believed to have killed as many as one million of his own citizens (see Dexter Filkins, “Regrets Only?,” <i>New York Times</i>, October 7, 2007). Countless international human rights reports and journalistic accounts describe the widespread nature of Iraqi human rights abuses under the regime of Saddam Hussein (See “Endless Torment: The 1991 Uprising in Iraq and Its Aftermath,” <i>Human Rights Watch</i>, June 1992, and “Iraq’s Brutal Decrees: Amputation, Branding, and the Death Penalty.” <i>Human Rights Watch</i>, June 1995, for two examples). I am also not aware of any circumstance under which the testimony of these individuals has been refuted.</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark10">precisely among those groups about which the regime was least informed. Ethno-sectarian and communal identities alone, therefore, cannot explain the wide range of behaviors observed on the part of Iraqi citizens.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">My argument is state-centric in the sense that it suggests states create the political behaviors that they face as a result of their policies toward their citizenries. While my theoretical focus is squarely upon the actions of the state, the state itself is constrained in a number of ways that limit its ability to pursue its preferred policies and achieve its desired outcomes. Most important, states are constrained by their financial and infrastructural, or bureaucratic, resources as well as by the inability of state political leaders to accurately predict or anticipate the response of international actors to their foreign policy initiatives.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In particular, the Iraqi state under Saddam Hussein faced three key con- straints on its power. First, Hussein was unable to render all parts of the country politically “legible” to the central government in Baghdad. What is meant by the term legible? Scott suggests that a central problem of statecraft involves effective “mapping” of a country’s terrain and its people to aid the basic functions of the state, including taxation, conscription, and the prevention of rebellion.<span class="s19">11 </span>From a political economy perspective, relatively illegible citizens and regions are those for which monitoring costs are high.<span class="s19">12 </span>This was a problem particularly for Iraqi government efforts to politically penetrate the three most northern provinces in Iraqi Kurdistan. Second, despite a well-educated population and abundant oil reserves, the Iraqi state proved to be highly vulnerable to economic shocks, many of which were induced by foreign policy crises. The devastating human and financial costs associated with the Iran-Iraq War and the catastrophic suffering caused by the international sanctions regime of the 1990s were two key contributors. Third, the Iraqi state under Hussein—not unlike other dictatorships which struggle to accurately assess the incentives and motivations of foreign governments— miscalculated the international response to key foreign policy decisions with important knock-on effects for domestic politics. For example, when Iraq invaded Iran in 1980, Hussein expected a war lasting weeks, not years. These three constraints—which are both structural and contingent in nature—form the political context for Iraqi politics in the late twentieth century.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">11.

While most of the literature on state- building has focused on the European experience associated with the devel- opment of strong territorial states,<span class="s19">13 </span>and on the African experience associated with states struggling to project political power across territory,<span class="s19">14 </span>I seek to understand how state power is projected in a context that might be more favorable for state development—the contemporary Middle East. Middle Eastern states—endowed with the financial resources to invest in governance structures and a conflict-prone external environment conducive to nation- building—would seem to present a relatively favorable set of conditions for creating robust states. Yet within the Middle East, there has been considerable variation in the strength of states despite a broad similarity of structural economic and international conditions. My findings suggest that certain parameters—like the difficulties associated with policing a diverse ethno- sectarian population—were built into the creation of the Iraqi state and proved difficult to manage over time. This was particularly the case as the state faced a tightening budget constraint as a result of poor foreign policy decision making. Although the dissolution of the Iraqi state was, indeed still may be, avoidable, the forces working against a unified Iraqi state are strong and self- reinforcing.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">The weakness of the Iraqi state has its roots in the construction of political</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">identity and social cleavage structures both during and directly after Hussein’s dictatorship. While most scholarly accounts of the determinants of societal cleavage structures have focused on the experience of democratic countries and emerging democracies,<span class="s19">15 </span>my arguments suggest when and why certain identities become salient across communities within an autocratic regime. My findings also challenge a conventional narrative about sectarianism in Iraqi society. The myth of monolithic Sunni, Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i, and Kurdish populations in an eternally and hopelessly fractured society belies both the multi-sectarian nature of collaboration with the regime, as well as the tremendous threat posed to regime stability by rivals within Hussein’s own Sunni community.<span class="s19">16</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;">Tilly 1992.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;">Herbst 2000.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;">E.g., Lipset and Rokkan 1967; Rogowski 1989; Posner 2004.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">See Kirdar (2009) for more on why it is misleading to characterize the Hussein regime as a Sunni regime.

The most influential work in this tradition has focused on generating typologies of authoritarian regimes. Geddes argues that single-party, military, and person- alist regimes are distinctive institutional types and that the strategic factors guiding politics in each context are different.<span class="s19">17 </span>One tension in this literature relates to how one should characterize those regimes that combine aspects of party organization, military rule, personalism and, sometimes, even hereditary succession.<span class="s19">18</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The focus on institutional type (e.g., military, party, personalist regime, or monarchy) represents a step away from a previous literature on non- democratic rule that offered reflections on how power was projected under autocracy and the lived experience of autocratic rule for citizenries. Arendt’s work on the origins and outcomes associated with totalitarianism is seminal; she defines totalitarianism as a “form of government whose essence is terror and whose principle of action is the logicality of ideological thinking.”<span class="s19">19 </span>For Arendt, the use of terror and ideology are an outgrowth of a regime’s desire to dominate all aspects of citizen life.

Linz focuses on the distinction between totalitarian and authoritarian regimes without regard for the precise institutional form. While he defines authoritarian political systems as ones with limited forms of political plural- ism, he sees totalitarianism, on the other hand, as having an ideology, a single party, and “concentrated power in an individual and his collaborators or a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">small group that is not accountable to any large constituency.”<span class="s19">21</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">While scholars of dictatorship have recently eschewed discussion of the totalitarian-authoritarian distinction, a core debate in the literature on Iraq under Saddam Hussein relates to whether the regime should be categorized as authoritarian or totalitarian. Complexities associated with understanding the role of repression, fear, and terror in the Iraqi case contribute to differences of interpretation.<span class="s19">22 </span>In <i>Republic of Fear</i>, Makiya argues that fear was “not incidental or episodic,” but rather constitutive of the regime itself.<span class="s19">23 </span>Dawisha writes that “unlike earlier authoritarian periods in Iraq . . .

In Linz’s conceptualization, the party is a critical component of totalitarianism; he writes that “only when the party organization is superior or equal to the government can we speak of a totalitarian system” (2000, 94). In addition, “propaganda, education, training of cadres, intellectual elaboration of the ideology, scholarship inspired by the ideology, rewards for intellectuals identified with the system” (Linz 2000, 71) are frequently associated with totalitarian rule. Totalitarian regimes also tend to be ones where a single leader is the “object of a cult of personality” (Linz 2000, 75). Although totalitarian systems are often characterized by violent coercion, for Linz (2000, 74) terror is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for defining a regime as totalitarian.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">See Faust (2015) for more on this debate.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Makiya 1998, xi. 24.

For Sassoon, Iraq under Saddam Hussein—while brutal and controlling—should be classified as authoritarian, not totalitarian.<span class="s19">28</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Part of the reason for this disagreement among various scholars relates to the differential treatment of citizens and groups of citizens across time and geographic region within the context of a single Iraqi “regime.” For example, tolerance of dissent declined for certain populations over time. This variation in treatment across groups within a single country, as well as for particular groups over time, is not unique; yet, empirical studies that use “regime” as the unit of analysis may place less emphasis on the issue of variation in governance forms within the borders of a single state.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">These concerns are especially salient for the undifferentiated conceptual- ization of repression or “punishment” in works of political economy. Pun- ishment, as it typically operates in autocratic regimes, is differentiated across groups and individuals and is also context-specific. This suggests the existence of <i>individualized autocracy</i>, or the idea that autocracy, as it is experienced by an individual citizen, is conditional on a variety of factors including the identity of that individual and his or her location within the broader political schema.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">identity in iraqi politics</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A starting point for most studies of Iraqi politics emphasizes the importance of the country’s multi-ethnic, multi-sectarian population. This is a sensi- ble line of reasoning. Iraq’s geographic position on the historical boundary between the Sunni Ottoman Empire and Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i Safavid Empire, as well as contemporary Iraq’s adjacency to the historical homeland of the Kurdish people—an ethnic and linguistic group indigenous to southwest Asia—would suggest the relevance of ethno-sectarian concerns. Indeed, as the Ottoman Empire came to consolidate its political control over the region that would become contemporary Iraq, the area was divided into three provinces centered</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">27. ibid., 221.</p><ol id="l7"><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Similarly, Alahmed (2009) criticizes portrayals of the Iraqi government as totalitarian since those depictions attribute undeserved omnipotence to the Ba<span class="s21">c</span>thist regime.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark14">around the area’s major population centers—Mosul, Baghdad, and Basra— which came to roughly correspond to the centroids of a Kurdish north, Sunni center, and Shi</a><span class="s18">c</span>a south, respectively.<span class="s19">29</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Prominent academic accounts focus on how historical antagonisms be- tween the Ottoman Empire and its Persian geopolitical rival generated a legacy of uneven distribution of positions in the military and bureaucracy across ethno-sectarian groups. Disparate access to state employment across groups is an undeniable feature of the postcolonial Iraqi state and a fact that has taken on a decisive role in many scholarly accounts. Wimmer, for example, describes Iraq as an example of an “ethnocracy” where Sunni nationalists ruled over Iraqi Kurds and Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a, who were largely excluded from bureaucratic and other opportunities.<span class="s19">30 </span>Osman argues that “the failure . . . to resolve inherent tensions between primordial sectarian identities” has been a defining feature of the modern Iraqi state.<span class="s19">31</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Journalistic accounts of Iraq also describe sectarianism as an enduring, seemingly inescapable feature of the country’s identity politics. Similarly, references to ethno-sectarian identities are ubiquitous in Western diplo- matic and intelligence reports about internal Iraqi politics. Yet this narrative assumes both too much and too little about the salience of ethno-sectarian identities. Such a narrative suggests that ethnic and sectarian identities have been the defining, overriding identity concern for the majority of Iraqi citi- zens. And such a narrative says almost nothing about when and how ethno- sectarian schisms emerge as salient when they do.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Increasingly, scholars specializing in Iraqi history have resisted the idea that ethno-sectarian conflict served as the country’s primary driver of political tension.

Many of these conversions were of nomadic tribesmen whom Sunni clerics viewed as “barely Muslims prior to their conversion” (Nakash 1994a, 456). Conversions were thought to take place for a variety of reasons including as a way to evade military conscription or as a form of opposition to Ottoman rule (Nakash 1994a). These conversions were most common in southern areas of Iraq which would have been influenced by Shi<span class="s21">c</span>i pilgrims traveling from the East to the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala.</p></li></ol><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">30.

Through an examination of the Iraqi case it is possible to explore the broad scope of repression intensity and govern- ment distributive strategies, as well as a wide variety of behaviors undertaken by a diverse citizenry operating in a high-stakes political environment.

Part of the reason for this focus is the untenability of accurately measuring beliefs for a period of time that has passed and for which there were no reliable ways to collect information, even if we could go back in time. Another part is equally practical—the data that I use to test the main theories laid out in this book are not attitudinal, but based on the observable, or quasi-observable, actions of individuals as collected or documented by the regime’s single party. There is also a tangible quality to behaviors, as behaviors reflect a commitment to action that is not always reflected in attitudes, which can be fast-changing and without clear consequences. While behaviors, too, are highly contextual and made under conditions of extreme political pressure, I believe that they reflect complex political calculations.<span class="s19">39</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Theoretical Contribution</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">This project focuses on how state actions explain citizen political behavior.

But what happens if the state’s financial resources decline? Or even worse, the state begins to demand costly service of the citizenry as a result of a foreign war or other external shock? As investment in the regime declines, or even becomes negative, citizens harmed by the negative shock may engage in anti-regime behaviors that the state seeks to punish. In such a setting, states attempt to sanction political transgressors, but often face an information problem—it is difficult to identify precisely who committed the transgression, yet the behavior demands a punitive response. This situation leads states to use forms of collective punishment, particularly directed against those segments of the population that are less legible to the state.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A primary argument of this book is that the use of collective punishment has important implications for both the beliefs and behaviors of citizens living in autocracies. When citizens are punished collectively (i.e., in a relatively imprecise manner), a number of processes unfurl. First, citizens know that the state’s ability to monitor them is weak, and this knowledge allows them to organize in relative safety, encouraging the creation of dense networks with high degrees of social cohesion. Second, when information-poor states punish citizens as a result of their membership in an identity group, this encourages the likelihood of in-group policing within that identity group as the actions of one group member are tied to the outcomes for all members. Finally, when punishment is both severe and collective, individuals increasingly come</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Recent research on distributive politics in the Middle East has tended to focus more on the distributive consequences of electoral authoritarianism (e.g., Koehler 2008; Lust 2009; Blaydes 2011; Masoud 2014; Corstange 2016); the impact of sectarianism on public goods provision (e.g., Cammet and Issar 2010; Salti and Chaaban 2010; Clark and Salloukh 2013; Cammett 2015); and the distributive policies of oil-exporting states of the Persian Gulf (e.g., Herb 2009; Harris 2013; Harris 2016; Hertog 2016).

When punishment takes place at the level of a smaller social group—impacting a collective that falls short of constituting a national group—the result is <i>communalism</i>. By communal, I mean related to a group or community including a cultural group, a religious community, or an extended kinship group, regardless of whether the kinship ties are actual or fictive.<span class="s19">42 </span>What determines the state’s choice to punish at the level of the nation or the subnational group? I argue that there exists variation within countries regarding the legibility of certain populations and this factor determines the precision with which punishment is delivered.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">This argument suggests that states create the citizen behaviors that they confront as a result of policy action, but the constraints that states face are real and binding. The first constraint relates to the evenness with which populations within society are legible to the state. A number of factors contribute to the legibility of sub-populations to the bureaucracy; language group and terrain or geographic accessibility are two highly salient factors. When groups speak a different language than the dominant language of the state and its bureaucracy, this increases the monitoring costs for the government. Similarly, when groups are located in or near geographic regions that are relatively inaccessible to the government, this also decreases the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Scholars have argued that African Americans, and members of other minority groups, often believe that their individual fates are linked to those of other African Americans, even substituting group utility for individual utility when making political evaluations (Dawson 1994). While research has suggested that the salience of linked fate is contextual (Gay 2004), it is a salient political narrative when considering the attitudes and behaviors of minority groups living under conditions of political repression. Relatedly, Levi and Olson (2000) describe workers associated with organized labor movements as being part of a shared “community of fate” as their interests are bound up with one another.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">My use of the term communalism differs, then, from those who focus on the principles and practices of communal ownership, often related to the study of communes and other forms of collective ownership. For the purposes of this study, communalism refers to the salience of group identity where such groups might include collectives associated with a variety of characteristics including ideological attachment, religious beliefs, or organizational and tribal identity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark19">ability of the state to monitor. Schutte (2017) uses a distance-decay model to show that violence becomes more indiscriminate with distance from the state’s power center. While physical distance is a powerful proxy for the use of indiscriminate punishment, </a><i>cultural distance </i>hinders a state’s ability to monitor to a degree greater than geographic distance alone.<span class="s19">43</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">That said, both of these problems can be overcome with a sufficiently large financial investment in monitoring. In some cases that means developing the bureaucratic capacity to effectively police less legible areas. While geographic factors would seem difficult or even impossible to impact for a state, the experience of Iraq under Saddam Hussein suggests otherwise. Although unable to raze the mountains in the Kurdish regions of the country, the Iraqi state sought to depopulate villages near the northern mountains and went so far as to drain the marshlands in southern Iraq.<span class="s19">44 </span>These extreme and costly measures were done with the goal of increasing the legibility of the Iraqi citizenry to the state.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The other binding constraint faced by states beyond the heterogeneous legibility of its population relates to the limited and variable financial resources that are available for governance. Proponents of rentier state theory have long argued that state-controlled natural resources provide countries with the means to distribute wealth to their populations in exchange for political support.<span class="s19">45 </span>Yet even countries that are endowed with such a favorable rent stream are subject to internationally driven commodity price fluctuations</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Fearon (2003) uses the structural distance between languages as a proxy for the cultural distance between groups; Blaydes and Grimmer (2017) determine cultural groups based on shared values (measured using public opinion survey responses) and then estimate the distance between groups. Cultural distance has been shown to be an important predictor of military effectiveness. For example, during the Second Chechen War large numbers of Chechens crossed ranks to work with the Russians. Lyall (2010) finds that Chechen soldiers were more successful at conducting counterinsurgency raids than their Russian counterparts. The implication is that cultural distance—as exhibited between Russian soldiers and Chechen civilians—resulted in less targeted and effective forms of punishment. Within sociology, scholars discuss social distance as multidimensional, with a cultural basis (Karakayali 2009). Bhavnani et al. (2014) define social distance as encompassing a variety of intergroup differences including class, ethnicity, religion, race, and variants associated with normative, cultural, and habitual perceptions of difference. Social distance might also be assessed in an empirical setting. Bakke et al. (2009) employ a social distance perspective, mapping the unobserved dimensions of social distance among survey respondents in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the North Caucasus region of Russia.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">Prior to their draining, the Iraqi marshlands were the largest in western Asia.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;">See Ross (2012) for a discussion of recent literature on this subject.</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark20">and other sources of financial instability.

Kalyvas, for example, suggests that while existing accounts of civil conflict tend to focus on preexisting ethnic, sectarian, or nationalist cleavages as the key determinant of conflict outcome, there exist a variety of endogenous, micro-historical mechanisms that influence the behavior of individuals.<span class="s19">46 </span>Lyall argues that, despite the fact that there is no consistent empirical relationship between state repression and collective mobilization, state repression can reinforce certain forms of group identity.<span class="s19">47 </span>Lawrence argues that French colonial subjects who were offered the full rights of French citizens were less likely to engage in anti-colonial protest; in other words, movements for political equality that emerged in the French empire were endogenous to the policies of the metropole.<span class="s19">48</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Mylonas considers the determinants and impact of three nation-building policies—accommodation, assimilation, and exclusion—on nationalism, par- ticularly among noncore groups (i.e., those groups that do not share the ethnic, religious, or sectarian identity of the host state).<span class="s19">49 </span>For Mylonas, noncore groups can be effectively assimilated if this is compatible with the host state’s external relations. Like Mylonas I argue that because individual behaviors are influenced by state actions, it is important to develop an account that can explain variation in policies toward various societal groups. Where I diverge from Mylonas is with regard to the locus of activation. While Mylonas argues that state policies are externally activated, I argue that attitudes toward noncore groups may also be activated <i>internally </i>as a result of government policies promulgated in the context of various constraints, limitations, and unforeseen (indeed, unforeseeable) external shocks.<span class="s19">50</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">For example, Kalyvas (2006, 132) argues that the most important factor favoring collaboration with the state is the level of territorial control where territorial control requires a “constant and credible armed presence.”</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">Lyall 2006.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;">Lawrence 2013.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;">Mylonas 2012.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">This is not to say that external factors are not important; I would argue that their relevance needs to be considered in the context of domestic political constraints, however, and</p></li></ol><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark21">Outcome Variables of Interest</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A first task for this project relates to defining the outcome to be explained— the range of observable behaviors undertaken by citizens in relation to the state. Previous scholarship has pointed to the complexities associated with understanding forms of political assent, dissent, and passivity. Levi argues, for example, that “compliance and non-compliance are not the simple dichotomous variables they at first appear to be,” suggesting a range of possible activities that reflect varieties of consent, volunteerism, and resistance.<span class="s19">51 </span>Scott makes the case for the existence of subtle forms of resistance to economic domination that go beyond characterizations of “blind submission and homicidal rage.”<span class="s19">52 </span>Indeed, Scott points out that rebellions—particularly among rural populations—are rare and that everyday forms of resistance among peasants tend to stop short of collective defiance. In his work on resistance to autocracy in Eastern Europe, Petersen describes the continuum of activities that might reflect an individual’s collaboration with or resistance to the regime.<span class="s19">53</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">What are the concrete behaviors that I seek to explain in this book?

In many autocratic settings, a primary way by which citizens might do this is by supporting or joining the regime party. Whether in single or hegemonic party systems, providing support for the regime party is an important marker of the regime’s political access and control.<span class="s19">54 </span>I provide detailed information about party identification based on tens of thousands of individual records of Iraqi high school students at four different points in time.<span class="s19">55 </span>I also provide evidence on the regional distribution of party rank based on the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party’s internal membership records.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="48" height="1" alt="image" src="10.23943_9781400890323/Image_002.png"/></span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">concur with Mylonas regarding the importance of endogenizing nationalist sentiment by taking state strategies into account.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">51.

This can take a number of forms and might include special bureaucratic designations, medals, or distinguished service awards. Ac- ceptance of such an award signals a willingness to associate oneself closely with the authoritarian regime. Using lists collated by the Ba</a><span class="s18">c</span>th Party, I am able to identify the tribal affiliation for thousands of Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party “badge” recipients. Because tribal affiliation provides indication of an individual’s sectarian and regional identity, I am able to make inferences about the distribution of the regime’s core constituencies. I can also identify the geographic distribution of the “friend of the president” bureaucratic status, a designation that provided special privileges to holders.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Another way that citizens can support regime objectives is to inform on fellow citizens or engage in other forms of regime collaboration. While this is often a private act, there are important political implications as widespread collaboration creates a climate of mistrust and fear. Citizens also seek out ways to become part of the inner-circle autocratic apparatus itself. In such cases, individuals may volunteer for regime-sponsored militias. Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party documents provide information about the many thousands of individuals who volunteered for militias—like the Jerusalem Army—both at the aggre- gate level, across regions of Iraq, as well as at the individual level for the Iraqi high school student population.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">An alternative to active complicity is the possibility for acquiesence or more passive forms of collaboration. Kalyvas surveys existing literature on conflicts between incumbent regimes and opposition groups and finds that only a small percentage of citizens actively support the armed opposition; this leads him to conclude that “most ‘ordinary’ people appear to display a combination of weak preferences and opportunism, both of which are subject to survival considerations.”<span class="s19">56 </span>Levi raises the possibility that “perhaps what we have come</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">See Kalyvas 2006, 103. Schedler (2013, 42) argues that most authoritarian contexts include the “bad, the good and the guilty—regime supporters, their opponents and the silent masses in between.” Yet such a characterization glosses over the difference between individuals who may appear to be supporters or fence sitters but who are actually quiet resisters. Scott (1985, 315–316) describes how economic and political oppression elicits certain, often quiet, types of political and economic resistance. In particular, Scott (1985) suggests how class rule might be enforced through the passive compliance of a subordinate economic class rather than more straightforward forms of coercion.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark23">to describe as compliance is actually a means of expressing consent.”</a><span class="s19">57 </span>In other cases, political elites create institutions that encourage compliance, including “rituals, symbols and propaganda.”<span class="s19">58 </span>Schedler argues individuals often “adapt to the realities of authoritarian governance by taking part in public rituals and official discourse, by applauding and falling silent at the right moments, by going into inner or outer exile, by ciphering or self-censoring their political disagreements.”<span class="s19">59 </span>For Scott, compliance can be the result of either resignation or more active forms of support. In either case, class rule is not enforced through sanctions or coercion so much as through passive compliance of society’s economic subordinates.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">On the other end of the behavioral spectrum are anti-regime and anti- government protest activity as well as other, more private, forms of political resistance. The existence of revolutionary social movements represents the most forceful and politically risky form of citizen non-compliance since collective action of this type deeply threatens either the existence or the territorial integrity of the state itself. In some cases, it might be defined as a civil war or sometimes even as domestic terrorism. For the Iraqi case, I am able to identify numerous memoranda documenting the nature of protest and resistance activities as well as regime documents outlining strategies for handling political transgressions of this type.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Much smaller in scale, but often more impactful, are attempts to seize political power via overthrow of an existing ruler or assassination of that ruler. An attempted or successful coup d’etat is often instigated by a small group; as a result, it lacks the scale of an insurgency. Political protest represents a third act of anti-regime activity that can take place either on a large or small scale.<span class="s19">60 </span>This</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">See Levi 1997, 18. The public transcript gives the impression that subordinate groups endorse their continued subordination within the prevailing power structure, while the private transcript might provide a totally different interpretation of political preferences (Scott 1990, 4–5). In such a setting, conventional behavioral measures may be “nearly indistinguishable from behavior that arises from willing consent” (ibid., 67). More quiet forms of political and economic resistance rely on coordination within the community of subordinate people where even the “social spaces where the hidden transcript grows are themselves an achievement of resistance” (ibid., 118–119).</p></li></ol><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">58.

In the strictly controlled information environment of many author- itarian regimes, the circulation of rumors represents another way that regime objectives are subverted. While some of these rumors may have explicitly anti-regime content, the mere circulation of unsanctioned information on almost any topic of social concern breaks the information monopoly dictators seek to maintain. I collect and report on the content of more than 2,000 rumors collected by the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party, the most common locations where rumors circulated, as well as the typical vectors of rumor dispersion.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Approach to Inference</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">My approach to making inferences relies on two factors—first, the short-term exogeneity in citizen legibility across different regional groups within Iraq and, second, the unanticipated impact of a series of externally driven shocks that forced coalitional realignment for the regime. Neither of these strategies approaches the gold standard for causal identification in the social sciences— the randomized control trial.

First, citizens are loathe to be alone in their anti- regime behavior, preferring the protection of crowds. In addition, protest behavior on the part of activists can trigger protest participation of more moderate individuals who differ from extremists in terms of how costly it is for them to falsify their preferences (Kuran 1991). Lohmann (1994) and Kricheli et al. (2011) both consider how incomplete information impacts the possibility for public protest participation.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">The behaviors that I am highlighting are not an exclusive list; rather they are emblematic of behaviors along a spectrum of possible behaviors. The specific types of behaviors that represent active collaboration, acquiesence, or resistance differ as a function of political and cultural context. Behaviors that are seen as resistance in one regime may be viewed as supportive in another, requiring a context-specific approach to defining the range of relevant behaviors for examination.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">While it is impossible to discern the political motivations of a single individual evading military service, there is little doubt of the net effect of the act when taken collectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark25">true natural experiments are rare, as are instrumental variables that meet the exclusion restriction.

While some parts of the country tend to be highly diverse with regard to the ethno-sectarian background of the citizenship, there are many areas of Iraq that were dominantly homogenous, allowing me to make some inferences about the behavior of citizens belonging to particular ethno-sectarian groups without much concern for problems of ecological inference. My goal is not to claim that ethno-sectarian groups behave in monolithic ways. Indeed, the evidence that I provide offers details about the within-group variation in political behavior. Rather, I take a regional approach to the study of Iraqi politics. One reason for this is practical; much of the data that I have collected suggest important forms of regional variation in political behaviors. More important, however, is the fact that prominent scholars of Iraqi politics have endorsed such an approach.<span class="s19">63</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Figure 1.1 provides maps displaying information about the ethnic break- down of the Iraqi population.<span class="s19">64 </span>This map suggests that the southern portions of Iraq are predominantly Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i, while the northern portions of the country are primarily Kurdish.

In Tikrit, regional identity is highly salient and a function of the relative weakness of local tribes as well as the geographic isolation of the area (ibid., 80). Visser argues that “in Iraq south of Baghdad, two non-sectarian ideological currents have historically been far more important than the idea of Shiite consolidation in a territorial bloc” (ibid., 29).</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="https://esoc.princeton.edu/" class="a" target="_blank">The map for ethnicity in Iraq in 2003 was produced using a shapefile available on the ESOC website (</a><span style=" color: #231F20; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 9pt;">https://esoc.princeton.edu/</span>), which relied on data from the Gulf/2000 Project at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="272" height="215" alt="image" src="10.23943_9781400890323/Image_004.png"/></span></p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 133pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Kurds</p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 133pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">Kurds &amp; Arab Sunnis Arab Sunnis</p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 133pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">Arab Sunnis &amp; Shi<span class="s26">c</span>a Arab Shi<span class="s26">c</span>a</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark26">0 65 130 260 miles</a></p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="78" height="3" alt="image" src="10.23943_9781400890323/Image_005.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="343" height="215" alt="image" src="10.23943_9781400890323/Image_006.png"/></span></p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 186pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">Kurds &amp; Arab Sunnis Arab Sunnis</p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 186pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">Arab Sunnis &amp; Shi<span class="s26">c</span>a Arab Shi<span class="s26">c</span>a</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">0 2 4 8 miles</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="81" height="3" alt="image" src="10.23943_9781400890323/Image_007.png"/></span></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Figure 1.1. <span class="s6">Ethno-religious population distribution across Iraq (top) and Baghdad (bottom).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">majority of Iraqi Kurds are Sunni.<span class="s19">65 </span>As a result, Kurds and Sunni Arabs have a shared religious framework that distinguishes those groups from Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i Arabs, who have historically been the plurality of Iraqi citizens.

The ease with which information could be gathered about opposition to the regime among Arab Sunnis left disgruntled individuals with less incentive to hide their beliefs. And while the Sunnis of Iraq typically were less aggrieved than either the Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a or the Kurds, there did exist variation within the Sunni community on this dimension. For the Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a, however, a shared language made their community more legible than the Kurds, but still less accessible than the Sunni, given the regime’s own origins within the Sunni community.

This strategy has been widely used by autocrats in a variety of contexts, including multi-ethnic societies like the USSR. In Iraq, the regime engaged in surveillance of the population both through its own agents as well as through the use of informants (Faust 2015, 155). Yet informants are unable to completely replace the infrastructural capacity of the state. For example, given the clandestine nature of much of the political activity in northern Iraq, the regime would have been required to have informants within relatively small units of Kurdish militants or be able to observe civilian support for Kurdish fighters that often took place under cover of darkness. An escalation of policing capacity, on the other hand, allows for forms of monitoring that are more effective against organizational compartmentalization, a common feature of militant groups. See della Porta (2013) on the issue of how clandestine groups are often both fragmented and hierarchical in their organization, which may help to avoid penetration by the state or to increase the difficulty of recruiting informants.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Fearon (2006) defines an ethnic group as socially relevant when people notice and condition their everyday behaviors on ethnic distinctions; ethnicity becomes politicized when political coalitions are organized based on ethnicity.</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark28">particular, I posit the existence of groups and then analyze the conditions under which group identity becomes salient.

Indeed, the positive economic conditions enjoyed by Iraq during the mid- to late 1970s proved to be favorable for handling such concerns. In the 1970s, Iraq was a rapidly modernizing state, flush with foreign currency reserves as a result of rising oil prices. The Iraqi state spent freely in a bid to extend its reach through the building of roads and schools and new job creation in the public sector. While the political elite was dominated by the regional and tribal kinsmen of Hussein, the benefits associated with the economic boom were felt by large swaths of the Iraqi population.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">But the economic expansion of the 1970s was interrupted by a costly war in the 1980s, followed by more than a decade of debilitating economic sanctions. Rapidly declining economic conditions had important political implications. And while there is little doubt that Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist-initiated foreign policy actions were undertaken with domestic political considerations in mind, evidence from a variety of sources suggests that the regime leadership often anticipated vastly different reactions by foreign powers than those actually observed. In fact, the Iraqi leadership was poorly positioned to predict many of the domestically relevant externalities associated with these foreign policy choices. In some cases, Hussein may have been insulated from high-quality estimates of success as a result of incompetent or sycophantic advisors. In other cases, he and his advisors may have misread signals from international actors or failed to make accurate predictions about how international actors would respond to his actions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">For example, Hussein invaded Iran in 1980, just months after the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran. Although there had been long-simmering griev- ances between the two countries, Hussein believed that the Iranians were</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">69.

Rather than lasting for six weeks—as had been anticipated by the Iraqi side—the war lasted for eight years. </a>Chapter 4 discusses both Iraqi regime expectations going into the conflict as well as the uneven distribution of human casualties on the Iraqi side. I argue that the political implications of war costs undermined investment in the regime among Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a who disproportionately bore the burden of war.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A second, critical strategic error relates to the Iraqi regime’s decision to invade Kuwait in August 1990. Some accounts have suggested that Hussein believed the United States would not intervene in inter-Arab disputes based on his July 25th meeting with then-US Ambassador April Glaspie, just eight days before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.<span class="s19">71 </span>Although accounts of that particular meeting vary, the result was that Hussein “seriously miscalculated Arab and Western opposition to Iraq’s annexation of Kuwait.”<span class="s19">72 </span>The 1990– 1991 Gulf War between Iraq and the United States (with its coalition partners) was a military conflict that Iraqi leaders did not anticipate would take place but, nonetheless, had far-reaching consequences for domestic Iraqi coalitional concerns. Most important, in March and April 1991, an anti- regime insurgency erupted in Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i and Kurdish regions of Iraq that left fourteen of eighteen Iraqi governorates outside of government control at its peak. These protests led Iraq’s three northern governorates to political autonomy and to a markedly different relationship between the regime and Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i populations of the country after 1991.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Finally, the United Nations Security Council sanctions imposed upon Iraq beginning in 1990 and continuing until 2003 were among the most stringent financial and trade restrictions ever inflicted on a developing country. The economic contraction associated with sanctions impacted all Iraqis, creating tension at many levels of society. Public sector employees saw huge income losses, increasing political dissension for Iraq’s large class of party and civil servants. And as state sector expenditures fell, Hussein and his immediate family increasingly monopolized income-generating economic opportunities, like smuggling. The net result was a decline in the financial benefits to all</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">The historical record on this issue is not entirely clear, in part because of the difficulty associated with knowing Hussein’s beliefs and expectations during the meeting.

For example, in the context of democratic regimes, Levi asks: “when are individuals actively consenting and when are they more passively engaged in conforming and acquiescing?”<span class="s19">9 </span>While both sanctions and incentives play a role in determining citizen behavior, Levi makes the case that at least some portion of observed compliance reflects belief in the “rightness of the policies and of the trustworthiness of the government actors implementing them.”<span class="s19">10</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Levi’s arguments about citizen behavior in democratic contexts reflect a vastly different set of conditions when compared with the behavior of citizens living under dictatorship, particularly highly restrictive autocratic regimes.<span class="s19">11 </span>In dictatorships, trust in government is often less salient than concerns about government sanctions or rewards. Some of the most influential work in the existing literature suggests that uncertainty about the preferences of others in society breeds compliance—until it doesn’t, when citizens engage in massive, and often violent, periods of popular revolt.<span class="s19">12 </span>Where existing scholarly work does point to quiet forms of resistance to political power, scholars suggest the importance of reading a society’s “hidden transcript.”<span class="s19">13 </span>But a great deal of political resistance exists between the realms of open insurgency and the subtle modes of resistance exercised by the weak.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">9.

A first explanation is related to fear and coercion where political abdication takes place in the shadow of intimidation. Ermakoff points out, however, that resistance often takes place under highly intimidating political conditions, suggesting a more complex narrative. For Ermakoff, the key to understanding collective abdication is considering how the actions undertaken by individuals are conditioned on the behaviors of other actors, where individuals highly value coordination with others. Through a process of “collective alignment,” members of a group facing the same decision align their behavior with one another. Alignment takes place sequentially where risks are assessed in light of the behaviors of others and political isolation is viewed as a bad outcome (182).</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">Kuran 1995.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;">Scott 1985.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Beyond resistance activity, there also exist important puzzles regarding when and why citizens actively cooperate with autocratic governments or engage in public behaviors that signal their support for the regime. Co-ethnic status would seem to be an important factor influencing support for incumbent authoritarians; existing work suggests that shared ethnic status with a ruler often leads to meaningful gains in public goods that an individual or community may not enjoy under an alternative leadership. Levi finds that under some circumstances, politically compliant behavior relates to habits of conformity.<span class="s19">14 </span>Common sense suggests that beyond material considerations, personal security would also be a powerful driver of collaboration with a sit- ting autocrat, particularly when a person or group shares some responsibility for past violence or atrocities. Yet, the literature in political science remains underdeveloped regarding the conditions under which citizen cooperation is most likely to occur.<span class="s19">15</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Other studies consider the role played by technocrats and party apparatchik who carry out the directives of the dictator.

While some of these habits may be learned, others could be the result of personality traits. Altemeyer (1998, 48) argues that individuals who exhibit an authoritarian submission trait tend to “believe strongly in submission to established authorities and the social norms these authorities endorse.”</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Schedler (2013) argues that political collaboration with an autocratic regime can take many forms—formal and informal collaboration as well as collaboration that exists within or outside of state institutions. Existing work that seeks to explain the provision of political support for dictatorship typically focuses on various classes of political actors. One class of studies emphasizes a dictator’s reliance on a small, trusted circle of political elites. This inner- circle might be built around a military academy class or as a result of shared co-ethnic, tribal, or regional status. By appointing individuals with close ties to serve as high-level advisors, dictators may miss out on the opportunity to appoint more competent bureaucrats, trading competence for loyalty. These individuals are often significant beneficiaries of the regime’s financial resources.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Scholars in the field of social psychology have made the largest advances in under- standing the conditions under which non-sociopathic individuals might participate in activities that would seem to be morally objectionable. For example, in his study of the Nazi doctors who sought to rationalize their participation in Hitler’s genocidal campaign, Lifton (2000 [1986]) argues that evil behavior needs to be understood in its context, arising out of “atrocity- producing situations” even in the absence of mental illness or a psychopathic disorder on the part of the perpetrators. Goldhagen (1996, 11–12) argues that there exist a number of different explanations for why individuals commit atrocities—that these behaviors were coerced, that perpetrators blindly followed orders, that they were subject to social psychological pressure to conform, that perpetrators were soulless bureaucrats pursuing their own career objectives,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark37">focused on political elites and their support for autocratic regimes tend to say little about how and why regular citizens collaborate with or reinforce forms of hegemonic control in autocracies.</a><span class="s19">17 </span>While material payoffs are a part of the conventional explanation, scholars have also pointed to the importance of the rituals of autocracy for encouraging forms of complicity and political domination.<span class="s19">18</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The primary argument of this book is that citizen behaviors in autocratic contexts are determined by the intensity and precision of expected rewards and punishments administered by the state. In this setting, the intensity and precision of rewards and punishments are subject to conditions and shocks that may be beyond the immediate control of the autocrat. In the next section, I discuss the basic assumptions of my project regarding the importance of incentives in motivating human behavior as well as how incentives shape be- liefs. I also define two dimensions of punishment and reward—intensity and precision. I describe how the intensity and precision of a given punishment or reward influence both investment in the authoritarian regime and beliefs about community cohesion. The section that follows discusses the theoretical framework as applied to the case of Iraq with a focus on the specific empirical implications of the project.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Incentives, Beliefs, and Behaviors</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">I take for granted that Iraqis, like other individuals, are motivated by in- centives that can take a number of forms, particularly financial and coercive incentives. Financial incentives exist when an individual expects a material reward in exchange for a particular mode of behavior. Coercive incentives exist when failure to adopt a particular mode of behavior leads to an expectation that an individual, or his or her family or community, will be punished in some</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="48" height="1" alt="image" src="10.23943_9781400890323/Image_009.png"/></span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">or that tasks associated with abuse were so fragmented, individuals did not understand their role in the atrocity. In the case of ordinary Germans carrying out the tasks associated with the Holocaust, Goldhagen (1996, 14) argues that anti-Semitism motivated the actions of Nazi and state apparatchik.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Kalyvas (2006, 180) distinguishes between collaboration and denunciation where de- nunciation refers to the provision of information about specific individuals while collaboration involves a much wider set of activities. Importantly, individuals may simultaneously publicly collaborate with the regime while engaging in private resistance activity.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">See Wedeen 1999. Also, see Faust (2015, 67) for a discussion of this point in the Iraqi context.</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark38">way. These punishments might include bodily harm, imprisonment, expropri- ation of property, or forced relocation.</a><span class="s19">19 </span>The idea that financial and coercive incentives motivate citizen behavior with regard to government directives and expectations aligns with what Levi calls “opportunistic obedience.” In this setting, individuals calculate the costs and benefits of actions and engage in “compliance due to fear of sanction or promise of inducements.”<span class="s19">20</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A second key assumption of this project is that citizen behaviors in authori- tarian regimes are governed by the interaction between incentives and beliefs. In particular, reward and punishment structures influence citizen beliefs and, when taken together with incentives, beliefs and incentives generate behaviors. What does it mean to say that incentive structures generate beliefs? By this, I mean that the manner in which citizens are rewarded or punished by the government influences the personal convictions that make up their worldview, including beliefs about government and also about the preferences and beliefs of others in their community.<span class="s19">21 </span>While state incentive structures influence multiple domains, in this project I focus on two main areas. The first is related to an individual’s beliefs about the performance, efficacy, and legitimacy of the political regime. The second relates to the politically relevant level and degree of social cohesion within one’s community.<span class="s19">22</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Grant (2006) considers the ethical implications of various incentive systems. She argues that while some incentives reflect a form of voluntary, economic trade from which both parties benefit, coercive incentives reflect a display of power that makes them ethically objectionable.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">See Levi 1997, 28–30. The assumption that individuals respond behaviorally to selective incentives, whether they be positive or negative inducements, is associated with Olson (1965) and has been applied most vigorously to the study of the free rider problem associated with collective action dilemmas. For Olson, selective incentives might take the form of less tangible benefits like social status or social acceptance. My argument differs, however, as I am suggesting that the incentive structure impacts beliefs about social factors.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">For example, in the field of sociology the “Pygmalion,” or Rosenthal, effect refers to a series of studies which show that the ways that teachers treat students influence the way that students behave, perform, and think about school. Work in the field of law and society suggests that perceived legitimacy regarding procedural justice by the government toward an individual and his or her group can strongly affect that individual’s beliefs about the legitimacy of the system (Tyler 2006). System justification theory suggests that individuals hold positive beliefs toward status quo social structures of which they are beneficiaries. Effort justification theory suggests that people place a greater value on an outcome when they put a great deal of effort into acquiring it (like being admitted to a club that subjects its prospective members to unpleasant treatment). In all of these cases, the way one is treated impacts beliefs about oneself or the world.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">My approach is related to that taken by Elster (2015), who argues that attempts to understand utility maximization need to be put in the context of psychological and other</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark39">Why is it important that incentives are not the sole drivers of human action? Beliefs are particularly important factors when discussing behaviors that are jointly produced, or rely on the collaborative effort of multiple actors. Beliefs about the preferences and expected behaviors of others in society may allow citizens to solve collective action problems, like the provision of a costly public good. Common knowledge encourages successful coordination of behavior by individuals who rely on shared understandings. A focus on incentives alone fails to take into account the types of social forces that allow individuals to aggregate their efforts into complex, and potentially costly, behaviors like rebellion or political subversion.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">This text also assumes that government policy can be understood through an examination of systems of rewards and punishments administered by states. While this focus is narrow as it under-emphasizes the importance of factors like individual leader attributes and political ideology and culture, I believe the categories of reward and punishment to be sufficiently broad as to capture the dynamics I see as core determinants of citizen behavior under conditions of autocracy. Relatedly, I make some critical assumptions about the differential ways in which rewards and punishment operate.<span class="s19">23 </span>For example, while inaccurately administered rewards giving would likely be welcomed by individual recipients as a windfall, the costs associated with imprecision in administration of punishment suggest a core asymmetry between the two concepts.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Finally, I presume that indiscriminate punishment by political regimes tends to backfire and, knowing this, regimes prefer targeted punishment, all else being equal. Scholarly consensus suggests that this is a widely held belief.<span class="s19">24 </span>This assumption also seems appropriate for the Iraqi case. Dimitrov</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="48" height="1" alt="image" src="10.23943_9781400890323/Image_010.png"/></span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">constraints, like the challenges associated with estimating risk, aversion to loss, and emotional reactions to unfair treatment. But while Elster (486) is focused on the way that “preferences and beliefs of an individual jointly induce actions,” I place greater emphasis on the role of incentives in shaping beliefs about government and the preferences of others in society. These beliefs are less related to psychological constraints on human cognition and more a function of reasonable inferences that one might make given a particular state of the world.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">For example, like Dari-Mattiacci and de Geest (2010), I assume it is harder to economize on rewards compared to punishment, as the threat to punish enjoys a multiplication effect while reward gets used up every time compliance occurs. This appears to be the case mostly when the threat to punish is meted out against individuals sequentially, limiting their ability to coordinate their actions.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Greitens (2016), for example, sees indiscriminate violence as self-undermining.

Kocher et al. (2011) find that bombing civilians systematically shifted control in favor of the insurgents during the Vietnam War. Condra and Shapiro (2012) find that collateral damage hurts both insurgent and regime sides during conflict.

A number of studies focus on why insurgent groups engage in indiscriminate punishment. Weinstein (2006) argues that rebel strategies regarding the use of indiscriminate violence differ for ideologically and materially motivated groups. Humphreys and Weinstein (2006) argue that the determinants of civilian abuse during civil wars are often internal to the structure of the warring factions themselves. In this project, I focus on indiscriminate violence undertaken by the state rather than insurgent groups, though some of the same mechanisms connecting collective punishment to identity formation may be relevant in the context of insurgent behavior as well.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">This is not to say that mistakes were not commonplace, a function of regime intelligence failures.

Incentives and beliefs, together, generate behaviors, many of which require coordination across societal actors. I focus on two beliefs in particular, a citizen’s investment in the regime, and his or her beliefs about societal cohesion. I argue that these beliefs are influenced by the systems of reward and punishment administered by governments where there exist important asymmetries in the way that rewards and punishment operate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Distribution and Punishment Regimes</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">There are two key dimensions to the systems of distribution and punishment used by dictatorships.<span class="s19">34 </span>The first dimension involves the intensity of punish- ment or reward.

Wintrobe observes that dictators do not rule through repression alone and, as a result, must “pay” for loyalty.<span class="s19">35 </span>In this setting, repression and co-optation are substitutes.<span class="s19">36 </span>For Gandhi and Przeworski, dictators share rents and make policy concessions to avoid rebel- lion.<span class="s19">37 </span>Magaloni argues that individuals are constantly updating their expecta- tions about economic growth, and holding authoritarian regimes responsible for recession.<span class="s19">38 </span>Blaydes sees informal rights to rent streams as important for maintaining elite coalitions; likewise, elites are forced to engage in downward provision of rewards to mobilize voters they have promised to the regime.<span class="s19">39 </span>Distribution of state wealth streams, services, and rents constitutes a key strategy for politicians to protect themselves from dissent and, maybe, even removal from office.<span class="s19">40</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Rewards influence behaviors in two ways. First, the rewards, or rents, themselves induce compliance as individuals enjoy the material benefits as- sociated with that transfer. Second, receiving private or public goods from the regime also increases an individual’s investment in the regime, both from a psychological perspective and from a forward-looking anticipation of future rent streams. If an individual is receiving private or public goods from the regime, that individual begins to assess the regime in a positive way. At the same time, individuals become more invested in the regime as they seek to maintain anticipated future benefits that they hope to enjoy.

In many ways, this framework relates to existing literature in the study of democratic politics on retrospective voting. In democracies, citizens evaluate performance of incumbents with implications for vote choice. In authoritarian settings, meaningful vote choice is not an option, but citizens nonetheless engage in processes of evaluating govern- ment and acting on the beliefs these evaluations generated. Objective per- formance indicators like GDP growth and unemployment matter for voters in democracies, but individuals are also concerned with their own personal well-being.<span class="s19">41</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">My conceptualization differs from backward-looking evaluations, however, as investment in the regime also depends on expectations about future ben- efits. In this conceptualization, investment acts like loyalty as described in Wintrobe.<span class="s19">42 </span>For Wintrobe, loyalty—defined as attachment to an organiza- tion or institution—is a capital asset that a dictator might invest in through the provision of public goods and patronage. Like Wintrobe, I see investment in the regime as acquired through the provision of material benefits including property rights to various rent opportunities. Unlike Wintrobe, however, I do not view loyalty, or attachment, as the key conceptual factor influencing behaviors; rather, I see investment in the regime as contributing to an indi- vidual’s belief about the value of current and future income streams. Part of this calculation is conditional on the extent to which others in the society also hold a high level of investment in the regime. This suggests that an individual’s investment in the regime depends, in part, on the evaluation of the regime by others in society.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">There are two dimensions along which reward can vary—in its intensity and in the precision with which it is distributed. Individuals who receive more goods increase their level of investment in the regime, though perhaps not in a linear fashion.

As a result, this is largely an unoccupied “cell” in the analysis. In addition, when rewards are low intensity, regimes may not deem it worthwhile to make the effort to identify the worthy recipients with a high degree of precision given the costs associated with bureaucratic investment. In other words, most of the empirical observations tend to exist along the axis involving rewards that are individualized/high intensity and collective/low intensity.<span class="s19">50 </span>It is also possible to imagine conditions under which states need to apportion burden as part of distributive politics.<span class="s19">51</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark43" class="s13">The framework I have described suggests a number of empirical impli- cations, summarized in </a>table 2.1.

If the state begins to distribute negative goods, in other words burdens upon a population, those burdens can also vary in their inten- sity and precision. In some cases, a “tax” might be levied on the population where everyone pays. The “tax” need not come in the form of a monetary assessment, but could instead include things like removal of subsidies, or a degrading of other public services, resulting in dissatisfaction and disaffection. Finally, when losses are individualized and high intensity, the result is disloy- alty that may or may not be expressed depending on the cost of doing so.</a><span class="s19">52</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">There are a number of implications of these arguments. Because autocratic regimes are vulnerable to economic and external shocks, such events have serious implications for their ability to maintain previous rent streams and associated investment in the regime. In good times, there might be sufficient rents to provide high-intensity, individualized rewards to core supporters of the population and less intense, more diffuse forms of benefit and public goods to others. Indeed, in Iraq during the 1970s, this was the case and, as a result, the country witnessed relatively high levels of active cooperation on the part of core groups and either passive collaboration or acquiesence on the part of others. One of the key arguments of this book is that a series of severe, prolonged, and largely unanticipated external shocks made it difficult for the Iraqi regime to maintain previous high levels of reward distribution with implications for political coalitions over time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Punishment and Its Impact on Social Cohesion</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">For individuals who enjoy high-intensity, individualized rewards from an autocratic regime, the incentives for active collaboration are strong. While there are some individuals who engage in political transgressions at any level of reward, it seems reasonable to assume that the number of such individuals increases—on average—as rewards, and associated investment in the regime, decrease. While many individuals who receive low, or even “negative,” rewards from the regime maintain a stance of passive neutrality, others will engage</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">What distinguishes a high-intensity, individualized loss from a punishment? Punish- ment is a penalty imposed for an outcome or behavior. A high-intensity, individualized loss may come about independently of a retributive logic. For example, a government policy that imposes a severe distributive cost on individual citizens—like a draft, for instance—should be thought of as a loss rather than a punishment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark45">in behaviors that the state seeks to punish. Underlying this perspective is the assumption that individuals derive utility from voicing their negative opinions about an authoritarian regime honestly, as doing so allows one to enjoy a feeling of self-respect and personal integrity.</a><span class="s19">53 </span>Indeed, a large literature in social psychology would suggest that individuals suffer forms of mental distress if they are not able to maintain a coherent sense of self where one’s actions are in line with one’s beliefs.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">But what happens when an individual acts upon the impulse to disobey an autocratic regime? Consider a situation where an individual citizen trans- gresses a regime directive. When a transgression occurs, a major challenge for an autocratic regime can involve identifying the individual or set of individuals deserving punishment for their actions. In other words, high monitoring costs are a key constraint on regimes in their efforts to disincentivize anti- regime behaviors.<span class="s19">54 </span>While monitoring costs might be decreased with techno- logical improvements—for example, the introduction of better surveillance methods—the challenge associated with identifying those responsible for unwanted behaviors is an enduring one.<span class="s19">55 </span>In the context of insurgency, Fearon and Laitin argue that “if government forces knew who the rebels were and how to find them, they would be fairly easily destroyed or captured.”<span class="s19">56 </span>Kalyvas concurs, arguing that selective violence is costly as it requires an intelligence- gathering infrastructure to locate enemies through the use of civilian collabo- rators.<span class="s19">57 </span>According to Greitens, “intelligence enables precise, selective, lower- intensity violence, against the right people and only when necessary.”<span class="s19">58</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;">Kuran 1995.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">For the Iraqi case, there seems to have been a desire on the part of the regime to make the punishment fit the nature of the transgression. For example, individuals who were believed to have chanted slogans against Hussein during the uprisings had their tongues cut out, individuals who shot weapons at party apparatchik had their fingers cut off, and those who urinated on pictures of Hussein had their genitals removed (Albrisem 2013).</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Lyall and Wilson (2009) suggest one avenue by which indiscriminate targeting may be increased as a result of technological improvements.

Since the regime cannot distinguish between members within it, group-level punishment increases identity for the group through a mechanism that is distinct from the distribution of goods to a winning coalition.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: right;">A starting point for this analysis assumes differential costs for collecting in- formation about opposition across societal groups.<span class="s19">61 </span>In the extreme, forms of collective punishment that target entire villages or regions might be observed. Knowing that repression has the potential to radicalize individuals, autocratic regimes—all else being equal—prefer targeted to indiscriminate forms of repression. The cost to the state of information collection has important implications for the forms of social cohesion that emerge across communities. There are at least three mechanisms by which this occurs. First, when acts of non-compliance are unobservable by the regime, individuals—knowing this— can organize relatively safely, encouraging the creation of dense networks with higher degrees of social cohesion. In other words, lack of state penetration of society creates the opportunities and incentives for coordination between</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">individuals.<span class="s19">62</span></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">The minimum legible group size takes a value of one when an individual is perfectly observed; group size is large if the regime only knows that the perpetrator lives in a certain area or has a certain ethno-religious identity.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">Bates 1983.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Greitens (2016, 45) argues, for example, that shared ethnicity carries a demonstrated informational advantage in authoritarian settings.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Petersen (2001, 15) argues that strong communities encourage individuals to engage in more high-cost political activities through a number of mechanisms. Information costs are reduced in more cohesive social units and recruitment for political action is more successful (ibid.). In addition, communities with high levels of face-to-face contact and dense networks of social interaction tend to weigh positive and negative status rewards for behavior more highly, leading individuals to be more likely to engage in potentially costly political activity (ibid.).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark47">Second, punishment of the collective creates incentives for individuals to develop closer bonds with those in their community.</a><span class="s19">63 </span>When information- poor states punish citizens as a result of their membership in an identity group, this encourages the likelihood of “in-group” policing as the actions of one group member are tied to the outcomes for all members.<span class="s19">64 </span>In the Iraqi context, poor monitoring capacity sometimes led the regime to use a dragnet approach to finding insurgents and other political dissidents.

For Fearon and Laitin, asymmetry of information makes it much easier for people to monitor and punish within their own ethnic groups as social networks are often more dense within ethnic groups compared to across groups. I make a similar assumption in this project. But while Fearon and Laitin are concerned with everyday inter-ethnic interactions that have the potential to spiral into broad forms of inter-ethnic conflict, I am focused on interactions between citizens and the state.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">See Faust 2015, 154. According to Faust (149), “if families did not disown their deviant individual members, more family members might die or be tortured, and the entire extended family would therefore fall under heightened suspicion.” In the extreme, if there were noncompliant members within an extended family whose actions posed a danger to the rest of the group, those individuals might be killed (Baram 2014, 110). Faust (2015, 3–4), for example, relates stories about individuals turning in or sometimes even killing their own sons and relatives for deserting from the army or failing to turn oneself in after deserting from the army. See Khoury (2013, 172–178) for a discussion of punishment at the level of the kin group.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">My argument also suggests that social bonds are critical determinants of citizen behavior in dictatorships, a perspective shared by a number of scholars. Gurr (1970) argues that when grievances are large and societal groups have elaborate networks with strong, cohesive identities, then anti-regime rebellion is a possible outcome.</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark48">tribal or ideological interests. According to Bengio, the chemical attacks on Halabja and other Kurdish towns were “a major turning point in the crystallization of Kurdish identity.”</a><span class="s19">67 </span>Why was the regime driven to take such destructive measures? Ahram summarizes this perspective, arguing that the chemical attacks were undertaken because local informants were not provid- ing sufficiently good information regarding collaboration between Kurdish insurgents and Iranian forces at the height of the Iran-Iraq War.<span class="s19">68</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The level at which these processes take place depends on how punishment is meted out by the state. When the state punishes at the level of the “nation”—impacting a collective with common characteristics like language, customs, and ethnicity—the result is <i>nationalism </i>for that collective.<span class="s19">69 </span>When punishment takes place at the level of a smaller social group, the result is <i>communalism</i>. Punishment of this sort impacts a collective which shares actual or fictive kinship or ancestral ties, in which case the communalism takes the form of tribalism or “clannishness.”<span class="s19">70 </span>In other cases, the community of interest is not kin-based, but instead based on common religious training or beliefs. For example, the followers and seminary students of prominent religious leaders can develop a salient communal identity based on their shared adherence to the teachings of a particular cleric. None of this is to say that communalism emerged in some segments of the Iraqi population exclusively as a result of the punishment strategies employed by Hussein. Rather, communal identity was one of a repertoire of plausible latent identities that increased in salience as a result of the nature of state punishment.<span class="s19">71</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">67.

This perspective is consistent with Faust (2015, 7), who argues that “the production of fear was not the primary purpose for the Ba<span class="s21">c</span>th’s violence.” Indeed, Faust (148) finds no evidence that the Ba<span class="s21">c</span>thist regime under Hussein “purposefully meted terror randomly in order to instill fear,” in contrast to Makiya’s description of the regime (1998, xi–xii).</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">More precisely, when the relevant collective is an ethnic group, the result is ethno- nationalism.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Throughout the project, I refer to nationalism in reference to Kurdish ethno- nationalism and tribalism in reference to identity considerations associated with group ties that rely on beliefs of shared kinship or ancestral ties.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Existing work highlights this statement.

Geographic accessibility—particularly the existence of mountainous terrain or other difficult to penetrate territories—also influ- ences a government’s ability to map an area, take a census, or engage in other forms of information collection.

Segments of society with more individualized punishment and lower levels of punishment intensity are able to publicly express forms of dissent with less risk, but have a more difficult time fos- tering social cohesion. Further, the ease with which information is gathered about opposition to the regime leaves disgruntled individuals with less of an incentive to hide their beliefs; agents of the regime are likely to ferret out their preferences anyway. Citizens recognize that regime penetration of their network means that even close associates might report their opposition beliefs to the government.

In these cases, the regime may have some idea about who perpetrated the transgression, but not enough information to identify an individual transgressor. Under such circumstances, trust and social cohesion develop at the group level, often to include members of a tribe or a communal religious society. It is also at the level of the group that transgressors might be reined in by those in their community in a bid to avoid group-level punishment.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Punishment precision and punishment intensity do not necessarily in- crease together. Indeed, communities are regularly sanctioned or deprived of resources in autocracies for non-compliance with government directives or expectations. For example, in Egypt under Mubarak, districts that voted for the Muslim Brotherhood in parliamentary elections received smaller improvements to their physical infrastructure.<span class="s19">85 </span>Similarly, a close associate of the dictator might receive an individualized reprimand for a transgression which would represent a low-intensity, high-precision punishment.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Yet cultural distance may be driving both the legibility of communities as well as a willingness to use intensive forms of punishment. This is, in part, because groups that are highly legible are often closely connected to the dictator. Citizen populations that are legible to a regime tend to be those that have the closest ties to the ruling elite; citizen populations that are less legible to a regime—as a result of language difference, geographic distance, or difference in ethnic identity—are typically less central coalition partners. Therefore, while all “cells” associated with levels of precision and intensity are feasible, precision and intensity are often inversely correlated, particularly for the most repressive regimes.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Table 2.2 provides a conceptual scheme for the relationship between the prevailing punishment regime and the form of non-compliance observed.

In this setting individuals decide whether to engage in rebellion knowing there is some probability that the government will punish them even if they do not rebel. For Machain et al. (2011) states come in two types, the “nasty” type which punishes indiscriminately, and the type that only punishes if acts of violence are committed and will only punish those who commit the rebellious acts. In my conceptualization, indiscriminate punishment emerges as a result of limitations to state capacity rather than as a function of state “type.”</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left:

Stein (1976) finds that there is no clear empirical relationship between conflict and group cohesion, in part, because the core concepts of conflict, group, and cohesion are not subject to a uniform definition. In this project, I offer a more specific definition of conflict— focused on state repression—and its impact on social cohesion, at various levels of “group-ness.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark53">particular starting point, however, complicating the issue of determining an empirical beginning for the analysis.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Greitens argues that the punishment repertoire of autocratic regimes re- flects the design of the regime’s coercive institutions.<span class="s19">88 </span>For regimes that were founded under conditions of a high potential for coup risk, coercive institutions tend to be fragmented and exclusive, both factors that hinder the collection of intelligence that allows for more discriminating forms of repression; this contrasts with unitary and inclusive security institutions, which are able to gather intelligence in a way that minimizes the use of indiscriminate violence. For Greitens, coercive institutions get locked into place based on the “dominant perceived threat” facing an autocrat at the time they come to power.<span class="s19">89 </span>For the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime in Iraq, coup risk would have exceeded threat from popular revolt at the time of the regime’s founding, suggesting a preference for multiple, overlapping coercive institutions built around a narrow cadre of regime loyalists.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A more flexible approach allows for the possibility of feedback loops, which are a common feature of complex political and social interactions. The interaction between punishment regime and the behaviors that punishment induces in a population undoubtedly exist in a dynamic system. In this setting, a regime’s system of punishment and reward serves as a key determinant of citizen beliefs and behaviors; those systems, in turn, are influenced by a state’s resources, bureaucratic capacity, and vulnerability to external shocks, which can lead to discontinuities in how rewards and punishments are meted out. Societal actors surely enter into interactions with the state with differing levels of investment in the regime and social cohesion. This suggests that for any given time period, levels of investment in regime and social cohesion reflect previous interactions with the state. In other words, a historical legacy of investment in state-building impacts citizen interactions with the state even after a new political regime has come to power.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In an optimal setting, dictators would know exactly how much reward to distribute in order to maintain the relevant coalition, as well as exactly who was deserving of punishment and how much punishment would be required to deter individuals from transgressing.

Indeed, an initial condition of weak state penetration of a community might lead to a spiraling of punishment and, potentially, rebellion. Similarly, reliance on a narrow, and narrowing, set of coalition partners might lead those individuals to become increasingly invested in an autocratic regime, particularly if they believe that their high level of investment in the regime may be costly for them should the regime collapse. As a result, autocratic regimes may begin, over the medium to long term, to exhibit the types of centrifugal and centripetal forces that lead groups of citizens further “inward,” toward the regime core, or “outward,” toward behaviors of private resistance, and potentially violent collective action.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">I will make the case in the next section for an empirical strategy that suggests the two key determinants of the reward and punishment regimes— the legibility of various ethno-sectarian groups and the position of those groups within a dictatorship’s coalition configuration—enjoy either a degree of short-term exogeneity (in the case of the group’s legibility) or are subject to unanticipated external shocks (in the case of the coalition configuration) that allow for forms of both cross-sectional and temporal comparison. These features of the Iraqi case permit me to engage in empirical analysis, despite the presence of complicated feedback channels in the state-society relationship.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">application to the case of iraq</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The goal of the preceding section was to provide a structured framework for understanding the political behaviors of individuals living in autocratic contexts, broadly, and in Iraq under Saddam Hussein, more narrowly.<span class="s19">90 </span>Much</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l20"><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">This project does not emphasize the important and interesting ideational and political cultural concerns that are discussed in prominent studies. For example, Baram (1991) describes how the regime used references to Mesopotamian history as a legitimizing political and cultural frame. Davis (2005) argues that historical memory plays an important role in ideology which, itself, is core to hegemonic projects like Ba<span class="s21">c</span>thism. Podeh (2014, 145) discusses symbolic celebrations related to Hussein’s birthday or other milestones; the goal was for these events to reach all parts of the country. The Ba<span class="s21">c</span>thist documents also provide details about the regime’s cultural concerns. In some cases, public works of art depicting Hussein were discussed in committee meetings where badly painted murals were scheduled for removal (BRCC Doc. No. 01-2665-0002-0166 to 0170, 1993). Hussein announced a decision in 1998 suggesting that schools and villages that did not include a national symbol should be renamed for well-known martyrs from the area; these names would be chosen by local councils and political leaders (BRCC Doc. No. 01-2804 0000-0242, September 29, 1998).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark55">of the existing work that seeks to explain citizen resistance to government directives focuses on factors like co-ethnicity, where co-ethnic status encour- ages compliance for a variety of reasons, some of which are material. On the other hand, having a different ethnic status than that of the autocrat might induce individuals to work actively or passively against the interests of the autocrat, again, for material and other reasons. While it may seem that Iraq would be a prime case for such an argument, citizen behavior in Iraq under Saddam Hussein exhibited tremendous variation within ethno- sectarian groups as well as for particular groups over time.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Part of the reason for the failure of naive cultural explanations is that they tend to overstate the homogeneity of co-ethnic behavior. And while the em- pirical analysis that I conduct is not sufficiently fine-grained to demonstrate the entire range of behaviors across individuals, groups, and regions, over time, I am able to describe empirically meaningful forms of both cross-sectional and temporal variation. In some cases, I am also able to provide outcomes of interest associated with variation across Iraqi tribes, both Arab and Kurdish.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The empirical predictions for the project emerge directly from the theoret- ical framework as applied to the two core dimensions of empirical variation— cross-sectional variation associated with ethno-sectarian differences across regions, and temporal variation associated with unanticipated shocks that impacted the nature of the Iraqi political coalition. A first prediction to emerge, then, relates to the behaviors of Iraqi citizens during the 1970s. A variety of evidentiary sources suggest high levels of private and public rewards during this period following the nationalization of Iraqi oil resources in 1972 and increasing global oil prices, especially in 1973. Relatively high levels of public cooperation, or at least political acquiesence, were common during this period. Where acts of political resistance did emerge, they were subdued with relative ease by the autocratic regime.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">During the Iran-Iraq War (1980–1988), the regime witnessed relatively high levels of both political collaboration and acquiesence by ordinary Iraqis. This was particularly the case for the first half of the conflict when the regime was able to provide politically meaningful forms of economic compensation for those individuals who lost family members in the war. During this period, ethno-sectarian identity did not make any Iraqi, including Kurds and Arab Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a, automatic enemies of the regime.<span class="s19">91 </span>Public forms of non-compliance,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">A notable exception to this statement relates to the experience of Iraqis of Persian, or Iranian, descent. On the basis of Persian ethnic background alone, the Ba<span class="s21">c</span>thist regime deported</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark56">like refusal to self-identify as a Ba</a><span class="s18">c</span>thist, were discouraged but did not result in an immediate threat to life and livelihood. As a result, areas subject to negative reward shocks were more likely to witness acts of non-cooperation. Sunnis from Tikrit and its environs received the largest benefits from having a Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist political orientation while simultaneously enjoying the lowest levels of grievance against the regime; as a result, we should expect those individuals to exhibit the lowest levels of small-scale public defiance.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Over time, however, the duration and cost associated with the Iran-Iraq War unleashed a number of dynamics that proved costly for the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime. First, as the budget constraint tightened with the duration of the conflict—a process exacerbated by a global drop in the price of oil in 1986— the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists were no longer able to provide the same levels of public and private goods to Iraqi citizens. As a result, citizens decreased their investment in the regime. Second, the cost of conflict was born disproportionately across the population where Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a shouldered a greater burden than other groups on a per person basis. This created an underlying level of grievance that eventually generated conditions conducive to rebellion. For Kurdish Iraqis, declining public goods provision as a result of a tightening budget constraint also decreased investment in the regime. In addition, when anti- regime activists engaged in cross-border collaboration with Iranian forces, the regime’s low levels of bureaucratic penetration in the Kurdish communities meant that the regime had difficulty identifying the responsible parties. When those associated with resistance activity could not be identified accurately, the Iraqi regime punished Kurdish citizens collectively in a manner that increased feelings of “linked fate” among Iraqi Kurds.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The 1990–91 Gulf War and associated Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i and Kurdish protests in March of 1991 were a turning point for the coalitional politics of the regime. Indeed, the uprisings represented among the most serious challenges to Hussein’s survival as a political leader. Spontaneous protests by Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i Iraqis in the areas most devastated by the Iran-Iraq War and Gulf War were eventually put down by the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists. Kurdish populations took advantage of regime weakness during the Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i uprisings to organize protests in the North, which led to the eventual establishment of an autonomous Kurdish zone.

Before 1991, political non-compliance was a costly—but not necessarily devastating—act on the part of Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a. Once the regime was able to recon- solidate forms of political power in the mid-1990s, however, severe punish- ment became the norm for even relatively small acts of non-cooperation. For the Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a, a shared language with the regime—Arabic—made their commu- nity more legible than the Kurds, but still less accessible than the greater Sunni community, given the detailed knowledge of Sunni communities possessed by the regime. As a result, punishment was often meted out on the level of the tribe or religious group, typically associated with the followers of a particular Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i cleric. One observable implication of this narrative is that levels of public non-compliance should decrease in Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i areas of southern Iraq replaced by acts of underground resistance.<span class="s19">93 </span>The use of collective punishment at the level of the extended family or religious affinity group encouraged forms of social cohesion that supported the spread of rumors, draft evasion, and circulation of banned materials, all of which rely on dense networks.

Rumors only spread as a result of conversations between people who believe that they enjoy—at least to some degree—trust with one another, as rumormongering was criminalized by the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists, a strategy typical in autocratic regimes.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">Changes in Iraq’s Sunni community behaviors might also be observed over time as well as in comparison to other groups.

As quality of life for non-Tikriti Sunnis declined during the sanctions period, individuals from this community were more likely to engage in acts of political non-cooperation and resistance. The result was an increasing number of Sunni-initiated overthrow attempts emanating from the military, all of which were thwarted as a result of regime penetration of those communities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">summary of empirical expectations</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">This chapter has provided a theoretical framework for understanding citizen behavior under conditions of autocracy.

Hussein spoke to Piro at length on a number of topics. He shared his belief that he had served the Iraqi people well. He was proud of the many social programs that he had created, particularly in the fields of education and health care.<span class="s19">1</span></p><p style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">From Hussein’s perspective, when the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party returned to power in</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">1968, the Iraqi people were impoverished and uneducated. Food was scarce, agricultural methods were primitive, and infant mortality was common, as was illiteracy. Over the course of the 1970s, however, the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party oversaw huge improvements in the employment opportunities and public goods provided to the Iraq populace. Beyond that, Hussein stated that the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party at that time was not even particularly cognizant of the sectarian identity of its party members. According to Hussein, he had not initially realized that one of his top officials, Tariq Aziz, was a member of Iraq’s Christian minority. When contemplating his legacy, Hussein said he believed that history would view him favorably for his fair treatment of all Iraqis.<span class="s19">2</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">While it is easy to dismiss Hussein’s statements as the delusional account of a cruel dictator hoping to curry favor with his captors, there is little Hussein stood to gain by misrepresenting his beliefs.

While the Iraqi state had long aspired to gain greater control over its the domestic economy, the nationalization of the Iraqi oil sector in 1972 followed by the sharp increase in world oil prices after the 1973 OPEC embargo provided the means by which state intervention in the economy might be achieved. The net result was that the Iraqi state was able to distribute wealth across society in a way that increased both citizen investment in the regime as well as citizen dependence on the state as standards of living improved. Sanford writes that “flush with mounting oil revenues, Iraq was able for some years to pursue its socialist model without having to make hard choices between solvency and other priorities such as welfare benefits, infrastructure development, and even armed forces modernization.”<span class="s19">3 </span>In other words, the state spent on everything in a way that increased its relevance in the eyes of the Iraqi population across the board. And because this spending was possible as a result of a natural resource windfall, no sectors were taxed in order to generate the revenue to spend.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">How does the experience of Iraq during the 1970s speak to the theoretical arguments that I have advanced? The implicit counterfactual that this chapter considers is as follows: how would Iraqi political development have progressed in the absence of the negative external shocks of the 1980s and, later, the 1990s? And if the state-building opportunities of the 1970s had continued, how might this have influenced Iraqi political identity in the decades to follow? The answer advanced in this chapter is that Iraq would have continued to develop along the lines of a typical authoritarian regime in the Middle East—repressive and corrupt, but intact and functional.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">My answer to this counterfactual also has implications for our understand- ing of Iraqi identity politics. A conventional narrative about the salience of ethno-sectarian politics in Iraq suggests the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime pursued a sectarian agenda that systematically excluded Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a and Kurds, creating forms of deeply held resentment that would eventually become politically insurmountable. While Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a and Kurds may have been shut out of the very highest levels of political power, non-Sunnis did reach high levels of influence within the regime and were major beneficiaries of state distributive</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: left;">Sanford 2003, 5.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark64">networks. In addition, when transgressions against the regime did occur, these actions were managed relatively effectively from the perspective of the regime. Thus, state- and nation-building in Iraq during the 1970s continued along a historical trajectory that long worked against sectarian identities. Why and how that trajectory was disrupted is the subject of the rest of this book.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">expanding the iraqi state</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Efforts at state- and nation-building in Iraq have faced serious challenges, many of which have been well-documented in a number of excellent country studies.<span class="s19">4 </span>A series of economic and political shocks over the course of the twentieth century, for example, encouraged forms of social instability asso- ciated with a breakdown of traditional social classes.<span class="s19">5 </span>Scholarly works also point to how the 1958 overthrow of the Hashemite monarchy introduced a period of increasing political instability which hindered state-building. Forms of political control in Iraq followed a pattern quite similar to those found in neighboring Arab states. Military overthrow of foreign-backed monarchs established Arab republics that repressed political opponents, only to be overthrown themselves by other military or political party factions.<span class="s19">6</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">This relative instability ended with the formal consolidation of political power in the hands of Saddam Hussein, who successfully sidelined his fellow Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist, Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, in 1979. Although it was at this point that Hussein took over formal control of the state as President, he had been highly influential in Iraqi governance since the 1968 Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist coup. In 1972, Hussein—Iraq’s Vice President at the time—nationalized Iraq’s oil industry. While not yet officially head of state, Hussein was widely believed to be the country’s dominant political actor, serving as a de facto president because of the influence he wielded. During the 1970s, and contemporaneous with Hussein’s rise to power, oil fueled Iraq’s economic expansion and was critically important in the nation-building process.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">E.g., Batatu 1978; Farouk-Sluglett and Sluglett 1990; Tripp 2000; Marr 2004; Dawisha 2009.</p></li></ol></li></ol><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">5.

Oil output increased from 1.5 million barrels per day in 1972 to 3.5 million barrels per day in 1979. This occurred during a period of rising oil prices leading Iraqi government revenues to increase ninefold during the oil boom.<span class="s19">7</span></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">State spending during this period sought to modernize Iraq’s infrastructure and industrial capacity. Yousif finds that public investment was the main driver of physical capital formation in the 1970s, which doubled between 1970 and 1975 and doubled again between 1975 and 1980.<span class="s19">8 </span>Investments were made into a variety of sectors, including mining, industry, construction, and communications. Ozly writes that “the Iraqi government spent $14.2 billion on economic development in the 1974–80 period,” including on “heavy industrial complexes . . . iron and steel mill(s) . . . the development of sulphur and phosphate extraction and processing and the fertilizer industries.”<span class="s19">9</span></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In addition to large industrial and infrastructure projects, the Iraqi state also invested in basic public goods which had the potential to dramatically improve citizen quality of life. Schools, universities, hospitals, and military bases were built and expanded.<span class="s19">10 </span>While Iraq had made major strides in the provision of public education leading up to the 1970s, momentum toward widespread literacy and higher educational opportunities increased after 1972. In 1978, the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party initiated a new program to eradicate illiteracy for all Iraqis between the ages of fifteen and forty-five. The program was ambitious in scope and accompanied by a mass media campaign; even opponents of the regime acknowledged the positive impact the program had on thousands of Iraqi citizens.<span class="s19">11</span></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Growth of the domestic economy led to accelerated demand for education by Iraqis; and the nationalization of schools in 1975 equalized access to education by making schooling free of charge.

According to Ayubi, the non-defense bureaucracy grew from 319,000 in 1967 to 558,000 in 1976 and 663,000 by 1978.<span class="s19">17 </span>In this setting, the state was a favored employer for many, including university graduates, and by the end of the 1970s the Iraq state was, by far, the country’s largest employer.<span class="s19">18 </span>Another large portion of the adult workforce was employed in the defense sector.

Sunni Iraqis from the areas in and around Hussein’s home region of Tikrit came to enjoy particular benefits from the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime. These political appointments were made on the basis of loyalty and trust rather than out of sectarian affinity, but the patterns of political appointment gave the ap- pearance of sectarian nepotism.<span class="s19">53 </span>In other words, the Sunni appearance of the regime did not necessarily reflect an anti-Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i or anti-Kurdish policy, but rather a desire to make appointments to those with the closest ties to Hussein—many of whom happened to be Sunni Arabs.<span class="s19">54</span></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">Indeed, during this period of time, it would have been difficult to locate a distinctly Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i identity or shared set of interests.

Because such large numbers of party cadre were themselves Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a, in many places anti-Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i discrimination would have amounted to Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i prejudice of other Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a.<span class="s19">58 </span>Batatu summarizes the relationship between the regime and Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a more generally:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Saddam Hussein does not discriminate against Shi<span class="s18">c</span>is.

A series of documents from 1977, for example, describe some of the forms of citizen- regime collaboration in northern Iraq. One file discusses how the village headman (<i>mukhtar</i>) serves as an important source of information about local affairs.<span class="s19">66 </span>The village headman was known to provide intelligence on the types of weaponry held by insurgents as well as details about the financial situation of the rebels and the nature of their communications equipment.<span class="s19">67 </span>At this time, the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party was also highly invested in cultivating ideological commitment toward the party, particularly by working through schools.

At the same time, however, these oppositional movements were relatively limited in scope and politically manageable for the regime, given the resources of the state.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">During the 1970s the Da<span class="s18">c</span>wa Party—an Islamist, Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i party—grew in strength and popularity. It is difficult to know precisely why the Da<span class="s18">c</span>wa Party enjoyed increased support and mobilizational capacity. On the one hand, Islamist political organizations benefited from increases in popularity during the 1970s across a variety of Muslim countries.<span class="s19">77 </span>It is also likely that increased Da<span class="s18">c</span>wa mobilization was driven by dissatisfaction with the avowedly secular nature of the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Rioting by Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i activists in 1974 and 1977 led to a repressive crackdown by the regime. Indeed, the mass protests in Najaf and Karbala in 1977 have been considered unprecedented, urban-based spontaneous demonstrations.<span class="s19">78 </span>Although these upheavals were a massive challenge to the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime, the government crackdown was relatively focused, limited in scale and scope. The Da<span class="s18">c</span>wa Party could not compel a majority of Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a to become politically engaged and mobilized. This was likely due to a combination of skepticism toward religious appeals as well as a recognition that the growth of the state sector provided meaningful benefits to large swaths of the Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i community. The behaviors of most Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a during this time period, then, might be characterized as somewhere between active collaboration and political acquiesence.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The next section examines regime efforts to monitor populations suspected of politically transgressive behaviors. I then focus on punishment and resis- tance for a particular ideological group—Iraqi Communists. The regime’s total suppression of political activity by Iraqi Communists suggests the ease with which the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists were able to eliminate an ideologically rival group during this period.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">The salience of nationalist, sectarian, Islamist, and other political identities is, to a large extent, a regional phenomenon that transcends any particular Middle Eastern state or a single state’s policies. This suggests that transnational trends influence the development of political identity in important ways. Understanding how and why certain regional trends emerge when they do is complex and beyond the scope of this project. Instead, I look at subnational variation in the influence of regime and state actions on identity formation, conditional on the existence of broad regional trends.</p></li></ol><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">78.

Punishment varied depending on the nature of the transgression and the identity of the perpetrator. In 1977, a secretary for a provincial security directorate was sentenced to two years in jail for anti-regime statements. Officers arrested him, while drunk, for speaking out against the ruling party, the revolution, and security officials. A man from Najaf reported he was arrested in 1978 for insulting then-Vice President Saddam Hussein. He was eventually transferred to the Revolutionary Court, where he received a three-year sentence that he spent in Abu Ghraib Prison.<span class="s19">85</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l30"><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: justify;">For example, the regime maintained lists of individuals who were reported to be Fatimi Party members (see Iraqi Secret Police Files Doc.

The relationship between the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party and the Iraqi Communist Party was not always hostile.

Ismael (2008, 311–312) argues that economic domination by a land-owning aristocracy created a large class of landless peasants, many of whom emigrated to Iraqi urban centers because of lack of opportunities. For example, in 1958, 1 percent of the population held 55 percent of agricultural land, while 64 percent of the rural population owned less than 4 percent of all cultivated land (313). Marxist groups began to organize in cities, making political connections to the urban poor and increasing the salience of Marxist ideas (318).</p></li></ol><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">89.

This interpretation is consistent with scholars who suggest that the 1970s wit- nessed profound transformations in the Iraqi economy as the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party took the lead in national development.<span class="s19">99 </span>Faust concurs, arguing that oil allowed the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists to “diversify and deepen their bases of support,” encouraging forms of allegiance that extended to large segments of the Iraqi population.<span class="s19">100 </span>It was during the 1970s that “the welfare state in Iraq” became a central aspect of life, investing more and more Iraqis in the regime from which they accrued material benefit through the regime’s resource allocation programs.<span class="s19">101 </span>In the words of Al-Khafaji, “in an oil-rich economy, state expansion proved to be a relatively easy task . . . the growth of state institutions dramatically altered the balance of power between state and society, to the detriment of the latter.”<span class="s19">102 </span>For some beneficiaries of regime largesse, particularly those associated with the inner circle of politics, this translated into active cooperation with Hussein’s regime. For the vast majority of Iraqis who benefited from the state’s social spending in a less intensive and more diffuse manner, however, the result was an increasing tendency toward political acquiesence and depoliticization. Ethno-national and tribal identities were less salient during this time period as the regime promoted a strongly nationalist rhetoric. One possible exception to this statement relates to the increased salience of Tikriti identity as the regime sought out tribal and regional kinsmen to install in positions that demanded</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">high levels of loyalty to the regime.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">At the same time, the need to punish large groups of citizens during the 1970s was minimized due to the relatively high level of citizen investment in</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;">Testimony of M.

Attrition warfare typically favors the side with greater resources and Iran had a popu- lation size three times as large as Iraq. On the battlefield, Iraqi troops were subjected to human wave attacks by Iranian paramilitary volunteer militias, like the <i>basij</i>. Huge numbers of Iranian fighters were killed in these offensives and when the attackers could surround an Iraqi unit, they stood to capture large numbers of Iraqi fighters.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">In 1984, the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime commissioned a special report on the number</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">of war martyrs, missing in action, and prisoner of war soldiers from Basra governorate.<span class="s19">2 </span>The purpose of the investigation was to provide special benefits to areas that had suffered the largest war burden.

In other words, even for geographically proximate and otherwise similar areas, the war burden could vary and the Iraqi regime was keen to identify those differences with the goal of recognizing and rewarding sacrifices in the interest of the nation.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">From an empirical perspective, I seek to address a series of questions: Which ethnic and geographic groups within Iraq bore the greatest burden associated with the wars? In what ways did the regime respond to declining citizen and soldier morale as a result of the losses associated with the conflicts? And how did conflict ultimately impact Iraqi citizen investment in the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime?</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">To preview the main empirical findings, I show that Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a were more likely than their Sunni counterparts (and much more likely than Iraqi Kurds) to have died during the Iran-Iraq War, even after taking into account the size of different sectarian groups within Iraq’s population. Government efforts to counteract declining citizen morale during the course of the war took a number of forms, including compensation for families of fallen soldiers, educational programs, and symbolic displays. I argue that despite expending considerable political and material capital in response to concerns about morale, the differential war costs significantly undermined investment in the regime, setting the conditions for the 1991 Uprisings which represented a critical political rupture.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">While Iraq’s Kurds were not subjected to high casualty rates in the Iran- Iraq War when compared to Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a, the conflict between Iraq and Iran had a comparably profound impact on political sentiment in the Iraqi North. Because of cross-border military and intelligence cooperation between Iran and Iraqi Kurdish groups, the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime felt compelled to engage in a series of massive and devastating acts of collective punishment that alienated Kurdish populations to an extreme extent. The nature of the Iraqi punish- ment regime also encouraged forms of social cohesion within the Kurdish community as Kurds came to increasingly see themselves as sharing a common fate at the hands of the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime. While Iraqi Kurds did not achieve effective autonomy until the 1991 Uprisings, the Anfal Campaign represented a seemingly insurmountable challenge to the possibility of Kurdish support for conventional forms of Iraqi nationalism.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The evidence presented in this chapter also speaks to the heterogenous effects of war on state- and nation-building. A conventional narrative sug- gests that war has a positive impact on the growth and consolidation of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark84">states.</a><span class="s19">4 </span>But when the costs of war are not shared across a country’s regional and communal groups, the differential impact of conflict on the citizenry can actually work against efforts at nation-building.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">iraq at war</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">During Saddam Hussein’s almost thirty years of de facto rule, the Iraqi regime initiated a series of externally oriented military interventions. Indeed, Iraqis lived under conditions of nearly continuous war for much of the time the country was governed by Hussein.<span class="s19">5 </span>At the start of the Iran-Iraq War, multiple potentially relevant cleavages existed within Iraqi society. One officially recognized designation was based on “national” identity where Arabs and Kurds were the two main identity groups. Sectarian identity—Sunni or Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i—was also salient for some Iraqis, though this distinction did not officially exist in party or state discourse. In addition, important differences persisted between urban Iraqis, who were less likely to rely on tribal identity, and rural Iraqis, for whom tribal affiliation was more politically salient. A primary argument of this chapter is that political and social developments that took place during the Iran-Iraq War and later, the Gulf War, placed a burden on particular communities within Iraq with implications for the salience of certain identities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Iran-Iraq War</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The Iran-Iraq War lasted eight years, a comparatively long time for a con- ventional modern war. One reason for the long duration was that each side had a significant, countervailing advantage. While Iraq enjoyed a military technology edge over Iran, Iran was able to deploy its much larger population in battle.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Why did the Iraqi regime enter into such an unpredictable and potentially destabilizing political conflict in the first place? There is little doubt that the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran had a profound effect on the political calculus of Hussein and his advisors.

This was even more so in the context of growing Iraqi Shi</a><span class="s18">c</span>i activism on the part of a religiously minded minority.

Thousands of Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a were deported and, in September 1980, Iraq preemptively attacked Iran, citing a series of border disputes as a primary motivation for the instigation of hostilities.<span class="s19">7 </span>The Iranian province of Khuzes- tan was a target of interest for Hussein because of both its large Arab population and its extensive coastline, which would enhance Iraq’s ability to export oil.<span class="s19">8</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">While the theocratic nature of the new regime in Iran surely influenced Hussein’s decision to invade, arguably even more important were tactical, rather than ideational, considerations. Iraq had long held a series of specific grievances against the Iranian regime. Among these was the need to reclaim Iraqi rights associated with the Shatt al-Arab waterway and a desire to obstruct Iranian military support for Kurdish rebels in the Iraqi north.

Yet the regime initially lacked high-quality information about the perpetrators. Special forces units of the Republican Guard undertook a variety of counterinsurgency strategies that reflected a lack of precise information about the identity of the perpetrators.<span class="s19">61 </span>All civilian vehicles were ordered to be searched out of fear that insurgents were hiding ammunition in cars. One individual who reported both Communist and religious sympathies said that he was rounded up in the wake of the uprisings even though he did not take part in the events.<span class="s19">62 </span>Another informant reports that during the uprisings, members of his military unit ran away, leaving their weapons unguarded.

Dawisha finds that “purposeful bombardment was aimed at houses with little regard for its occupants, and people were indiscriminately shot in the streets . . . within less than three weeks, over 30,000, including women and children, had been killed, and some 70,000 had fled the country, mainly to neighboring Iran.”<span class="s19">65 </span>Eyewitnesses in cities like Basra and Karbala reported</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;">North Iraq Dataset Doc.

Mackey (2002, 296) argues that one important factor was that some of the important Shi<span class="s21">c</span>i tribes did not participate in the uprising or remained neutral during the rebellion. Dawisha (2009, 236) suggests that the tribally oriented Sunni Iraqis from Anbar and Salah al-Din had too much to lose should the uprising succeed and, as a result, “savagely put an end to the rebellion.” He also points out the importance of the neutrality or even regime support offered by some Shi<span class="s21">c</span>i tribes of the south.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">CRRC Doc.

Telegrams describe how ordinary life was returning to Karbala.<span class="s19">68 </span>Army units and special committee members, however, continued to search for rioters in the province. The mayor of Karbala was replaced and the regime assigned a Republican Guard special forces unit to the area to continue purging rebels.<span class="s19">69 </span>There were many local-level party members—including a number of women—who served as informants and witnesses, providing long and detailed reports about uprising participants, their place of residence, and their family affiliation.<span class="s19">70 </span>During this period, Hussein suggested that the most loyal individuals should be praised while acknowledging that it was difficult to find reliable supporters.<span class="s19">71</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Following the regime’s repression of the southern uprisings, families of Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a suspected of anti-regime activities were increasingly targeted in a bid to elicit confessions and information. Disappearances became common and even individuals who were not involved with the uprisings became victims of state abuse. Makiya writes that beginning in 1991 Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a became a “target” of the regime for the first time in modern Iraqi history.<span class="s19">72 </span>For example, one man from Najaf reported that his son fled to Saudi Arabia following the uprisings.<span class="s19">73 </span>The son eventually returned to Iraq and reported for military service, at which point he was arrested and executed.

Seven months after the uprisings, the University of Basra, together with Iraqi intelligence, prepared a classified report about the participants in the revolts based on questionnaires that had been administered to prisoners. The results of the report suggested that urbanites, including marsh Arabs who had relocated to urban areas, were much more likely to have participated in the revolts than Iraqis living in rural areas. According to the report, income was not a significant predictor of participation. National and party organizations had failed to offer adequate support to soldiers with- drawing from Kuwait, particularly psychological services, a fact that spurred discontent.<span class="s19">85 </span>From the perspective of Hussein, the uprisings represented a failure of the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party, which was supposed to serve as a societal bulwark against anti-regime sentiment.<span class="s19">86</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">measuring the human cost of conflict</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">While it is difficult to estimate the absolute number of military and civilian casualties as a result of the Iran-Iraq War and Gulf War, Iraqi archival sources provide important evidence regarding the relative distribution of war costs across the Iraqi population.<span class="s19">87 </span>This section describes the evidence regarding this distribution of war casualties in Iraq. I focus on war costs conceptualized in three different ways. The first is the individuals killed, missing in action, and taken as prisoners of war between September 1980 and October 1984.

The regime collected a great deal of information about the war burden with an eye toward compensating the families of war martyrs. Using this information, I have sought to provide more precise data regarding the relatively uneven distribution of war burden across Iraq’s multi- ethnic community. Information about war casualties in the first four years of the Iran-Iraq War were found in a series of Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party memoranda from October of 1984 that provide provincial, and in some cases, district- or village-level information on three dimensions: number of individuals killed, number missing in action, and number taken as prisoners of war.<span class="s19">90 </span>Khoury has argued that after 1984–85, desertions among rank-and-file members of the Iraqi military increased exponentially,<span class="s19">91 </span>suggesting that the casualty estimates generated in October 1984 would not be impacted as significantly by desertions. In order to estimate the number of casualties per capita, I calculate a weighted average of the 1977 and 1987 province-level population estimates from the Iraq census.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Table 4.1 presents the distribution of war burden.

Cross- border alliances between Iran and, at first, the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) and, later, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), represented a major threat to the Iraqi regime. At the start of the Iran-Iraq War, animosity between the KDP and PUK gave the Iraqi regime confidence that Kurdish factions were so busy fighting each other that they would not pose a chal- lenge to regime interests.<span class="s19">94 </span>The Iranian offensive into Kurdistan in 1983, however, changed the value of Kurdish loyalty and resistance.

Northern governorates typically saw fewer distinguished families when com- pared to other parts of the country, consistent with arguments about the unreliability of Kurdish fighters. Notably, governorates in the central part of Iraq saw relatively fewer distinguished families than in the southern regions. Indeed, Salah al-Din—the home province of Saddam Hussein—saw one of the lowest number of distinguished families in the country.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Table 4.3 includes information collected by the regime on the number of families who lost three or more first-degree relatives in the Gulf War and subsequent 1991 Uprisings.

Later, military intelligence investigations were conducted which revealed that some of the distinguished families had been given the designation as a result of the deaths of individuals who were participants in the 1991 Uprisings rather than those killed trying to put down the anti-regime protests. As a result, about 10 percent of the families had their designation rescinded following the investigation.</a><span class="s19">100</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Handwritten notes on the regime documents provide more details regarding why the designation was rescinded.<span class="s19">101 </span>For example, Sulaymaniyya families that fled to Iran were removed from the list even if members did not actively participate in the anti-regime protests. In other cases, the family may have come under suspicion because an uncle or other second-degree relative participated in the riots. In Basra, Dhi Qar, and Qadisiyya, however, families that were removed typically had a father or a son who participated in the protests, carried weapons, or joined a mob that had attacked Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party cadre.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">There are a number of key inferences to draw from these data. The southern and Euphrates regions saw the largest numbers of casualties from the Gulf War and 1991 Uprisings. This is the case even after taking into account the possibility that some of the fatalities were due to anti-regime participation in the 1991 Uprisings. Again, Basra governorate saw the largest number of killed during the Gulf War and 1991 Uprisings, with 4.2 distinguished families per 100,000 population. This might be compared to Salah al-Din province, where there was only one distinguished family. This suggests that southern governorates bore a larger war burden than other parts of the country, and even within the predominantly Sunni parts of Iraq, Salah al-Din region suffered the fewest conflict-related fatalities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Iran-Iraq War and Gulf War Casualties</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A final source of evidence regarding the distribution of Iran-Iraq War casu- alties comes in the form of information gathered as part of a student census</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">100.

This included disseminating political propaganda that promoted the image of Hussein as a dedicated public servant, holding general elections in October 1984 where 40 percent of seats were reserved for Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i deputies, and providing state support for the manufacture of consumer goods, despite wartime austerity.<span class="s19">104 </span>The conflict also provided opportunities to encourage nationalist sentiment.

High performers in the military could receive a Mercedes Benz for their service.<span class="s19">106 </span>The next sections focus on three main government activities: providing financial and other forms of compensation for martyr families, inflicting punishments on the families of deserters, and state-sponsored efforts at boosting citizen and military morale through various forms of educational and nationalist programming.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Compensating Martyr Families</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Maintaining the morale of both the population and the army itself became an important priority of the regime. In the early years of the war, when Iraq was still flush with cash reserves, Hussein recognized the hardship associated with war casualties and provided generous financial compensation.

Scholars have pointed to a number of factors, including the ineptitude of commanders who were primarily party cadre rather than trained military tacticians; the tendency of Hussein to micro-manage combat operations from Baghdad with poor knowledge of military strategy or on-the-ground conditions; and the lack of horizontal communication within the army, which would have facilitated cooperation across units (Pelletiere 1992, 42–43). Murray and Woods (2012, 7) have suggested that the Iraqi military was kept weak intentionally, arguing that “Iraq’s military, in the 1980s, was as effective as Saddam wanted it to be, but not as effective as he needed it to be.”</p></li></ol><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">104.

While the Ba</a><span class="s18">c</span>thist regime was initially able to insulate itself from the political damage of the Iran-Iraq War through a robust program of compensatory spending, war costs eventually overwhelmed the regime. The collapse of world oil prices in 1986 meant that the regime struggled to provide payoffs to citizens at precisely the time they were bearing the largest burdens associated with the conflict. By the end of the Iran-Iraq War in 1988, the Iraqi state was shackled with a debt in excess of $80 billion, much of which was owed to Arab Gulf states. According to Alnasrawi, Iraq spent 254 percent of all the oil revenue it had earned over almost sixty years in just the eight years of the Iran-Iraq War.<span class="s19">168</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">In this chapter, I provide empirical evidence for the unequal distribution across population groups of war costs associated with the Iran-Iraq War and the Gulf War and discuss the political implications of these costs for the Iraqi state. While it is generally accepted that Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a were the majority sectarian group represented in the army, particularly among the lower ranks, the extent of Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i casualties in the two conflicts had not been measured previously. I show that Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i families were much more likely to have had a son, brother, or father killed in either the Iran-Iraq War or the Gulf War than their Sunni or Kurdish counterparts. In some cases, the losses suffered by Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i families and communities were staggering, particularly in southern districts like Basra. And despite regime fears of Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a acting as a “fifth column,” there are strikingly few reports of Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a seeking to undermine the country’s war effort in any way.<span class="s19">169 </span>These trends provide evidence for the existence of a hierarchy of burden associated with the foreign policy decisions of the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">According to Kubba, political awareness among Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a was relatively low before the Iran-Iraq War but increased significantly as a result of the conflict when it became clear that state policies would have such a profound effect on the well-being of so many citizens.<span class="s19">170 </span>And despite regime attempts to mitigate the costs associated with the war, the mounting financial and social costs of conflict imposed a tax on the Iraqi citizenry that encouraged political dissent, which took a number of forms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l50"><li><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Alnasrawi 1994, 100.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kerry 2008, 17.

I find that Sunni Arabs from western provinces like Anbar, who had previously been beneficiaries of state largesse, were increasingly shut out of economic opportunities at both the elite level and in terms of assistance afforded to the general population.

Not only were sanctions an economic shock outside of the control of the regime (Rohde 2010, 102), it was also very difficult for the regime to estimate the economic consequences of the embargo.

Among the most devastating effects related to the country’s physical infrastructure. For example, a report issued after the Gulf War suggested that in Basra only one-quarter of sewage pumping stations were operating.<span class="s19">12 </span>Loss of electrical power in many areas made it impossible to run pumps and generators, including for water treatment.<span class="s19">13  </span>Iraqis reported that directly after the conflict there was no water, electricity, telephone, or gas service.<span class="s19">14</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The combined impact of damage to the electrical plants, water purification facilities, and sewage systems directly affected the rise of both typhoid and cholera, which were at very low levels of prevalence prior to the Gulf War.<span class="s19">15 </span>Because hospitals did not have proper illumination, hygiene equipment, and water supply and disposal, the medical system was poorly positioned to assist the ill.<span class="s19">16 </span>Although the government undertook a series of campaigns to repair damaged infrastructure, these efforts were only partially effective.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">While the damage to infrastructure affected Iraqis across the income spec- trum, other aspects of the economic fallout impacted specific segments of the population more than others. Sanctions severely limited state income streams and left the Iraqi state reliant on about $800 million per year earned through smuggling oil to Turkey and Jordan, as well as liquidation of hidden assets, and government gold reserves.<span class="s19">17 </span>Middle-class Iraqis, particularly state employees, experienced economic strain as the government struggled to pay civil service salaries.

According to Graham- Brown, “when applying for a ration card each person or family is required to produce a civil status identity card, and confirmation of domicile, endorsed by the neighborhood headman, plus a card containing security information.”<span class="s19">36 </span>These checks of security service status and residence created difficulties for families who had members at odds with the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party or who had failed to complete their compulsory military service.

For a two-year period, families were punished collectively for the behavior of individual deviants on their ration card, but eventually this practice was abandoned when the regime realized that “the policy of collective punishment was counteracting the regime’s efforts to win over the support of the population and alienating families who otherwise supported the regime” (ibid.).</p></li></ol><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">42.

might we measure the impact of sanctions on the Iraqi population both before and after the introduction of the Oil-for-Food program? </a>Table 5.1 provides information on two indicators related to childhood nutrition across Iraqi governorates at two points in time: 1996, before the first Oil-for-Food program deliveries arrived, and in 2003, immediately after the US invasion of Iraq. The indicator “underweight” provides information on the percentage of children who are low weight given their age. The indicator “wasting” provides information about children’s weight given their height.<span class="s19">76</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="48" height="1" alt="image" src="10.23943_9781400890323/Image_020.png"/></span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">prohibited from taking revenge against regime officials who had acted in their official capacity (Faust 2015, 145).</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Other important indicators relate to human capital development during the sanctions period.

Shi</a><span class="s18">c</span>i-majority governorates (like Basra, Muthanna, and Karbala) have larger percentages of underweight and wasting in 1996 than Sunni-majority governorates (like Anbar and Salah al-Din). However, within the Sunni areas, there is a large discrepancy between outcomes in Salah al-Din (Hussein’s home province) and Anbar. While percentage underweight in Anbar was 22 percent in 1996, this figure was only 15 percent for Salah al-Din. And while 11 percent of Anbari children were described as wasting in 1996, that figure was only 7 percent for children from Salah al-Din. This suggests health disparities across ethno-sectarian communities, but also within them.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">When examining the data for 2003, percentages of underweight and wasting decline as a result of the introduction of the Oil-for-Food pro- gram. Baghdad and autonomously governed Kurdish areas witnessed major improvements. In the case of the former, this was almost certainly a result of robust distribution networks in the capital city; for the latter, it was widely believed that the Kurdish areas were more capable and less corrupt in getting resources to their citizenries when compared to areas governed by the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party. Another notable pattern, however, relates to how poorly Anbar fared relative to other parts of the country. By 2003, Anbar had the highest percentage of children described as wasting and among the highest described as underweight. In many cases, the children of Anbar compare poorly to children in Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i-dominated areas of Iraq. Poor health and wellness outcomes for Iraqi Sunni children defy popular characterizations of Hussein’s regime as one that benefited Sunni Arabs to the exclusion of others.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">political implications of sanctions</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The international sanctions regime had far-reaching political implications for the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists.

One cause was the downsizing of the Iraqi military which disproportionately affected western Sunnis who were prominently represented in these units.</a><span class="s19">84 </span>At the same time, elite units—in which Sunnis from central Iraq were often over- represented—were paid in US dollars as a way to insulate those troops from the effects of inflation.<span class="s19">85 </span>The Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime was forced to limit the distribution of state largesse as a result of a tightening budget constraint.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">To what extent would regional or tribal elites feel impacted by the negative economic shock suffered by non-elites in their home area? Elites, as a result of their privileged political and economic status, would seem to be insulated from the effect of sanctions. Tribal structures meant that elites were held responsible, to some degree, for the welfare of their tribal constituents and clansmen. As a tribal head, or leader within the tribal community, it would not be unusual to receive requests for assistance from less wealthy tribesmen, including for jobs and donations.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In sum, the economic embargo led to a narrowing of Hussein’s support base over the course of the 1990s.<span class="s19">86 </span>This narrowing “heralded a real change in Sunni opposition to the regime” and “a deepening cleavage” between groups within the Sunni population.<span class="s19">87</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Monopolizing Illicit Activity</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A major source of illicit revenue during this time was derived from illegal oil trade.

The authors of the report consider 1996 as a turning point for the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists with the introduction of the Oil-for-Food program. Iraqi revenue went from $250 million in 1996 to $2.76 billion in 2001. Hussein—while opposed to “corruption” on the part of his underlings soliciting bribes or appropriating public assets—reserved the right to distribute the economic opportunities associated with the improving economic situation for himself.

Commitment and service to the party and the state could be signaled through costly action, providing an individual with a justifiable claim to payment. The information provided by collaborators was particularly valuable to the regime during times of conflict when Kurdish resistance had the potential to join with foreign enemies of the state to undermine regime security and stability. The exchange further suggests the limits on the regime’s ability to satisfy the financial expectations of its collaborators.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l66"><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: left;">Iraqi Secret Police Files Doc.

The collaborator’s photographic surveillance likely substituted for an on-the-ground presence, and local knowledge would have helped the collaborator determine the location of rebel weapons caches otherwise unknown to the regime. In this chapter, I argue that the relative illegibility of the Kurdish population to the Baghdad- based government led the regime to pursue suboptimal policies—particularly forms of collective punishment—toward the Kurdish population, at times of political and economic crisis. Although there had long been tension between Kurdish peoples and Arab-dominated governments in Baghdad, Kurds were not automatic enemies of the Iraqi state. Indeed, co-optation of Kurdish citi- zens and political groups was common and there existed meaningful forms of collaboration between the Iraqi regime and Kurdish constituencies. There is also evidence that the Iraqi regime in Baghdad understood that fair treatment of the Kurdish people would allow for greater forms of political cooperation.</a><span class="s19">5 </span>I argue that for Iraq’s Kurdish population, broad-based cohesion as a nationalist group did not emerge until the end of the Iran-Iraq War. Scholars have long argued that factionalization within the Kurdish community has historically been so deep-seated that until that point there existed “virtually no sense of cohesive Kurdish nationality.”<span class="s19">6 </span>How, then, did Iraqi Kurds overcome factional differences to create the bonds of social cohesion and nationalist sentiment that made it possible to separate from the Baghdad-based govern- ment?<span class="s19">7 </span>Or, as McDowall puts it, how did Kurds go from being a factionalized</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">How do nation-building policies impact citizen attitudes toward the state? Miguel (2004) finds that serious, long-run nation building reforms can encourage the successful bridging of social divisions in ethnically diverse societies. A state policy of high relevance relates to the equitable regional distribution of public investment. These intuitions apply to the Iraqi context as well. Widespread, largely equitable distribution of public goods invested Iraqi citizens in the state and regime. In my account, I argue that, in addition, the intensity and collective nature of punishment contribute to the structures of societal cleavage.</p></li></ol><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">6.

Structural accounts typically emphasize a series of slow-changing political, social, and economic forces. For example, Fearon and Laitin (2003) define the set of conditions—like rugged terrain and low levels of per capita GDP associated with weak state capacity—which make armed resistance most likely to occur. Cederman et al. (2011) find that structural economic inequalities are predictive of civil war onsets; Cederman et al.

While Staniland does not go as far as to describe social ties as exogenous, he argues that “leaders embedded in social bases cannot fluidly reshape their social relations or political meanings” (2014, 24). The focus is squarely on the organizational, and to some degree cultural, history and constraints associated with particular rebel organizations.

On the one hand, increased oil revenue was a boon to the Iraqi economy, pro- viding significant new opportunities for Iraqi Kurds. The construction sector expanded with new public works programs<span class="s19">49 </span>and “many Kurds integrated into Iraqi society, taking advantage of the educational, commercial, and cultural opportunities that were tied to the country’s new oil wealth.”<span class="s19">50 </span>Improved economic conditions and growing job opportunities also made it difficult for nationalist movements to recruit supporters as citizens became increasingly invested in the regime.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, as oil became more important as a resource of the state, there was a greater desire on the part of Baghdad to control the northern city of Kirkuk and its environs as this area enjoyed the greatest geographic concentration of oil reserves.<span class="s19">51 </span>The nationalization of fifty-five wells in the Kirkuk oil fields in 1972 was seen as an affront to Iraqi Kurds, who had hoped to lay a regional claim to those resources rather than transferring ownership to the Iraqi state.<span class="s19">52 </span>McDowall writes that while “at the beginning of 1974 oil revenue was expected to be ten times higher than in 1972 . . . a huge resource was now at stake.”<span class="s19">53 </span>A major strategy of the central government was to engage in a process of Arabization of Kirkuk and adjacent oil-rich areas, granting land deeds to Arabs and removing Kurds from these areas.<span class="s19">54 </span>Large numbers of Iraqi Kurds were forced to move their residence during this time.<span class="s19">55</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l71"><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;">Ibid.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;">McKiernan 2006, 57.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bulloch and Morris 1992, 147. 50.

But when Iran signed the Algiers Agreement with Iraq in 1975 to end support for the movement in exchange for rights to a portion of the Shatt al-Arab waterway, the Kurdish resistance was largely brought to an end. This likely reflected a lack of commitment to open conflict with the Iraqi regime by the majority of Iraqi Kurds as well as important political divisions within the leadership of the Kurdish nationalist movement.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">At the same time, Mustafa Barzani received criticism from a variety of groups for advocating the continuance of what was seen as a largely ineffective rebellion. McDowall writes that “the most bitter pill for Mulla Mustafa [Barzani] was the defection of his eldest son, Ubayd Allah, who claimed his father wanted to be an absolute ruler and did not want self rule even if he was given all of Kirkuk and its oil.”<span class="s19">65 </span>Coupled with the increased investment in Kurdistan by the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists, it seemed to many that there was little to gain from rebellion. In reference to Kurdish areas, McDowall writes:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The Iraqi regime invested heavily in the area in order to provide a level of economic satisfaction . . . its collective village program created over 30,000 dwellings, at a cost of almost 90 million dinars. It also allocated 336 million dinars on developing the region, building up industry, laying metalled roads, building schools and clinics. Schools increased fourfold between 1974 and 1979; hospitals were built . . . and tourist facilities developed. Indeed, the Iraqi government probably spent more per head of population in Kurdistan than elsewhere in the country during the second half of the 1970s.<span class="s19">66</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Regime documents from this period point to considerable Kurdish collab- oration with the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists as well as indications that Iraqi Kurdish citizens sometimes felt victimized by Kurdish nationalists.

According to Valentino (2004, 4), “when perpetrators perceive the stakes to be high enough, and when less violent alternatives appear to be blocked or unworkable, however, the incentives to consider mass killing multiply. In this context, repression associated with guerilla conflict is the single most common motivation for mass killing.

And party cadre thought that by increasing investment in development projects in Yezidi areas, Yezidi leaders might be able to influence the rank and file to resist the pull of Kurdish opposition forces. In a discussion of a dispute between members of the Yezidi sect and local tribesmen, it was suggested that the regime seek a speedy resolution of the conflict lest Kurdish groups make overtures to the Yezidis in a bid to win them over politically.<span class="s19">174</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In 1991, shortly after the eruption of popular uprisings in southern Iraq, Kurdish militias recognized that there was a unique opportunity to organize anti-regime protests in the Iraqi North.

Two less direct streams of evidence also support this perspective. The first is that what it means to be a Kurd differs in relation to what it means to be a citizen of Iraq, Turkey, or Iran (Natali 2005, xviii). In particular, Natali (2005) argues that Kurdish movements differ hugely as a function of national policies of the countries in which they live. The result was a “tendency of Kurdish nationalists to see their own political future in terms of the non-Kurdish state in which they live” (Bulloch and Morris 1992, 232). A second form of evidence comes from an examination of what happened in Iraqi Kurdistan after 1991. While cooperation between Kurdish groups persisted initially through the elections of 1992, conflict between the PUK and KDP eventually broke out over disparities in economic resources associated with control of the border crossing to Turkey (Romano 2006, 209). According to Romano (210), “although the Kurdish population at large perceived the overarching need to unite in the face of the threat from Baghdad, KDP and PUK party elites were unable to put aside their differences.” While Iraqi Kurdish populations continued to think of themselves in terms of their Kurdish national identity, the civil war between Kurdish factions suggests the context-specific nature of cooperation between groups.</p></li></ol><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">200.

My interpretation is also consistent with Alahmad (2009), who argues that the brutality associated with the Ba<span class="s21">c</span>thist counterinsurgency reflected regime weakness and a state with limited ability to patrol its own territory. Alahmad argues that while the genocidal qualities of the Anfal Campaign have led some scholars to believe that the Iraqi state was all-powerful, in fact the way the Anfal Campaign was perpetuated actually suggests precisely the opposite. This is not to say that the events of the Anfal Campaign were not a genocide. Alahmad (2009, 33) argues, however, that focusing on the morality of the campaign (and the tendency to compare the events to the Holocaust) obscured a broader understanding of the politics of violence in the counterinsurgency context. For Alahmad, the use of chemical weapons against Kurdish populations was not a deliberate genocide against an ethnic group, but rather a miscalculated genocidal strategy of a weak state along a war front.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">202.

In </a>chapter 2, I argued that material payoffs induce citizens to invest in autocratic regimes since such benefits lead them to positively assess the regime and come to believe that others may as well. Participation in the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party provided Iraqis with a crucial avenue for access to regime-distributed benefits. Yet our understanding of empirical patterns in the distribution of these benefits is largely impressionistic.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">In this chapter, I examine three measures of Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party participation which provide insight into the cross-sectional distribution of party benefits. In all three cases, the data are drawn from the mid-1990s and early 2000s. The first is official participation in the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party, with a focus on the geographic distribution of Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party members at various levels within the party hierarchy. I find that while Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party membership varied considerably across Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i areas it tended, on the whole, to be lower than in Sunni-majority regions. In addition, membership in Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i areas tended to be skewed toward the lowest ranks of participation, suggesting smaller payoffs for the majority of Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a who did actively engage through party channels.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party also created additional designations of distinction. For example, some individuals enjoyed “friend of the president” status with associated benefits.<span class="s19">10 </span>I find that predominantly Sunni provinces in central Iraq tended to have the largest concentrations of “friend of the president” beneficiaries. Third, I analyze the distribution of the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party “badge,” which was given to a subset of individuals with long-standing service to the party. I find that party badges disproportionately went to individuals with tribal origins from areas regionally adjacent to Saddam Hussein’s hometown of Tikrit.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">In sum, the cross-sectional evidence on the distribution of party-based benefits during the last decade of Hussein’s dictatorship suggests two key points. On the one hand, the incentives to affiliate with the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party were sufficiently appealing to induce large swaths of the Iraqi citizenry—from</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: left;">Magaloni 2006.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Technically, the designation was “friend of Mr. President Leader, Saddam Hussein,” which I will shorten to “friend of the president” throughout.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark170">across all ethno-sectarian groups—to participate in party structures. On the other hand, I show that higher-order benefits associated with the Ba</a><span class="s18">c</span>th Party disproportionately went to individuals who came from the geographic regions closest to Tikrit, as they served as the regime’s loyal core.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark115" class="s13">One of the political implications associated with the uneven distribution of rewards was investment in the regime by various constituencies was also uneven. In </a>chapter 5, I showed that sanctions differentially impacted segments of Iraq’s Sunni community; Sunnis from Salah al-Din province tended to fare relatively well during the sanctions period compared to those from Anbar. How did differential provision of distributive benefits impact citizen behaviors? For individuals with a negative assessment of the regime, feeling compelled to show support for the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party could be a source of personal anxiety and distress.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">One way that dissatisfaction with the regime might be expressed was through withholding support for the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party. The outcome variable on this subject for which I have the greatest temporal range is party iden- tification for a particular subsection of the population—Iraqi high school students. Information was gathered about the political “orientation” of stu- dents beginning in the 1980s; in particular, students across Iraq were forced to state whether they were either Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist in their orientation or political “independents.” When the stakes for non-cooperation were relatively low, this indicator might be thought of as a barometer of citizen backing for the regime. For situations where the cost of non-cooperation was high or rising— in particular, for Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i communities after the 1991 Uprisings—the reluctance to eschew support for the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party suggests a closing of political space for public dissent.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">I find that during the 1987–88 academic year, at the height of the Iran-Iraq War, Iraqi students of a variety of ethno-sectarian backgrounds had the ability to abstain from identifying with the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party. In that context, non-cooperation was highest in Iraqi Kurdish areas, which had been subject to the Anfal Campaign, and in the southern city of Basra, which had been particularly hard-hit in terms of war casualties. During the 1991–92 academic year, reluctance to identify as a Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist was common across Iraq as the regime struggled to find its political footing in the wake of the 1991 Uprisings; indeed, many Iraqis believed that the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime would soon fall. Over time, however, the regime began to reconsolidate and reestablish its repressive capacity. By the 1995–96 academic year, the core districts of</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark171">Salah al-Din province, including Tikrit and al-Daur, saw large increases in Ba</a><span class="s18">c</span>thist political orientation, as did predominantly Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i districts in southern Iraq where increased scrutiny of Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i students raised the cost of expressing dissent. By the 2001–2002 academic year, the only Iraqi students who chose to avoid identifying with the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party were from western provinces, like Anbar.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Taken together, the findings presented in this chapter speak to the condi- tions under which individuals identify to a greater or lesser extent with the hegemonic party in a one-party state. Cooperating with the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party and its directives increased an individual’s <i>intrinsic </i>utility as party participation provided economic benefits and opportunities.<span class="s19">11 </span>Yet for some Iraqis, their overall assessment of the regime led them to wrestle with how to relate to the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party. In particular, those with low levels of investment in the regime derived forms of <i>expressive </i>utility by withholding cooperation. This option was not available to all Iraqis at all times, however. Under highly repressive conditions, the costs of non-cooperation became so high that intrinsic utility concerns necessarily swamped the impulse for self-expression.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the ba<span class="s49">c</span>thification of iraq</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The government under Hussein has been described as having three main pillars: the party, the military, and the bureaucracy where the party dominated the other pillars.<span class="s19">12 </span>Faust argues that the “Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thification” of Iraqi society involved integrating Iraq’s diverse population into a single Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist nation while at the same time organizing the Iraqi state and society around party structures.<span class="s19">13 </span>The Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party constituted a parallel government in many ways, and was the key institution through which the regime operated.

While the vast majority of students are identified in the Registers as Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists, there do exist students who are identified as independent and the percentage of politically independent students varies over time and space. The vast majority of students have a “good” reputation in the School Registers. Nationality (<i>qawmiyya</i>) does not refer to Iraqi nationality, but rather whether the student is an Arab, Kurd or, much less frequently, Turkman or other group member. Sectarian identification in terms of the Sunni-Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i designation does not appear at any point in official documentation.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">For the fourth item, the “Mother of All Battles” refers to the student and his family’s position on the Gulf War.

These privileges in- cluded additional “points” added to his children’s school applications, the honor of meeting the president once a year, special grants and holiday bonuses, priority over others Iraqis in meeting with government officials, and an annual gift of two summer suits and two winter suits, among other things.<span class="s19">70</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">One main way that someone might receive a “friend of the president” card was if they had an immediate family member killed in either the “Mother of all Battles” or “Saddam’s Qadisiyya”—information about casualties in the family were recorded as the eighth item on the list. “Saddam’s Qadisiyya” was the regime’s name for the Iran-Iraq War, referencing the 636 CE Arab Muslim defeat of the Sassanid Persian army. After the Gulf War, individuals who died in the Iran-Iraq War or the Gulf War were often posthumously awarded the “friend of the president” designation.<span class="s19">71</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The ninth question relates to whether the student volunteered to par- ticipate in Hussein’s personal militia unit, “Saddam’s Fedayeen” (<i>Fida’iyyu Saddam</i>).<span class="s19">72 </span>Sassoon describes this group as a militia established after the disappointing performance of local Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party and army units in the wake of the 1991 Uprisings.<span class="s19">73 </span><a href="#bookmark267" class="s13">Results associated with question nine will be presented in chapter 10.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The final question that appears in the Registers relates to student par- ticipation in “Day of Pride” (<i>Yawm al-Nakhwa</i>) national training exercises sponsored by the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party.

While some students had personal or familial experience with the effects of regime repression, others felt as though their ethnic group, religious order, or tribe had been mistreated by the regime. Consequently, individual behavior was a function of both the repressive environment and one’s investment in the regime. For individuals from groups outside of the regime coalition, any suggestion of disloyalty might bring scrutiny, reducing the incentive to express one’s true feelings toward the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">Figure 7.1 displays four maps of Iraq.

While data were either not collected or not available for Tikrit and adjacent districts, it is apparent that areas of northern districts around Sulaymaniyya and Mosul had large numbers of politically independent students, as did Basra. The relatively large num- bers of politically independent students in Basra is not surprising given the concentration of Iran-Iraq War casualties there. Low levels of Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party political identification in Iraqi Kurdistan is also unsurprising given the events associated with the Anfal. Across majority Sunni areas, there was variation in the percentage of politically independent students where Fallujah and</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark182">Ramadi appear to have witnessed larger numbers of students who eschewed Ba</a><span class="s18">c</span>th Party identification. During this period, to self-identify as a political independent was a choice available to individuals.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The 1991–1992 academic year represented a low point for the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime. Reeling from the loss of the Gulf War and the shock of the 1991 Uprisings, the regime faced a series of crises that, at the time, seemed in- surmountable. Iraqis from a variety of backgrounds, including Sunnis from Saddam Hussein’s home region, came to believe that public opposition to the regime was intense and that the United States would be able to enact regime change, should it desire to do so. In other words, investment in the regime was particularly low and Iraqis increasingly held the belief that their fellow Iraqis felt the same way. The upper-right quadrant provides information for the 1991–1992 academic year. Notice that data do not exist for many of the far northern districts. These areas were already autonomous in the wake of the 1991 Uprisings. The regime was highly vulnerable to overthrow at this point and levels of grievance were high. It may have also been unclear at this point in time if the regime had the capacity to crack down on political independents.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">By 1995, the internal security situation had stabilized to a degree. The lower-left quadrant presents the percentage of politically independent stu- dents in the 1995–1996 academic year. This represented the worst period of the economic sanctions era, as the sanctions had been in effect for five years and the Oil-for-Food program had not yet been implemented. The Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party was reportedly so unpopular at this point that the regime had to pay officials to attend public ceremonies.<span class="s19">78 </span>It is important to note, however, that even though Sunni areas show relatively large numbers of students who are identifying as non-Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists, these figures were improving from the perspective of the regime in places like Tikrit and adjacent al-Daur. In addition, students in the predominantly Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i regions were increasingly identifying as having a Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist political orientation, suggesting greater compliance with regime expectations.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">By 2001–2002 (lower-right quadrant), we observe that the primarily Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i districts of the south have extremely low percentages of political indepen- dents. These results are consistent with scholars who argue that it was not until the late 1990s that the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party was in a resurgent position again.<span class="s19">79</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">78.

Areas of Anbar governorate, including the districts of Qa<span class="s18">c</span>im, Ana, Fallujah, and Ramadi, maintained some political independents. Mosul and two surrounding districts in the Iraqi North also saw relatively large numbers of political independents. As an Iraqi Sunni, one way a person might show discontent was to avoid joining the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party.<span class="s19">80 </span>This option was too costly for some, however.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Figure 7.2 provides information about the percentage of students with an independent political orientation from across neighborhoods of Baghdad during the 2001–2002 academic year. The predominantly Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i neighborhood of Saddam City had among the lowest percentage of politically independent students. In contrast, the primarily Sunni Karkh neighborhood of central Baghdad had the highest percentage of politically independent high school students. Consistent with the cross-sectional, national variation in political orientation, non-cooperation was more possible for Sunnis than for Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a in the 2001–2002 academic year. This is despite the fact that support for the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party among Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i students was almost certainly low for this period.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The behaviors summarized in the maps suggest that the Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a transition from first, an oppressed minority group where non-compliance was a costly,</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">80.

One observable implication of this narrative would be that over time, levels of public non-compliance should decrease in Shi</a><span class="s18">c</span>i areas of southern Iraq, replaced by more private acts of resistance. For Sunni Iraqis from the Tikrit region, preference for independent political status was high for 1991–1992 but low for other periods. This suggests that support for the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party— even in areas of core loyalist support—was conditional. But Sunnis from other parts of Iraq—like Anbar—were much less likely to say that they were Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists, even into the late period. This regularity is repeated when examining variation within Baghdad during the 2001–2002 academic year.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ba<span class="s49">c</span>th party membership and mobilization</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">While much has been written about how Iraq’s culture of fear induced political compliance,<span class="s19">81 </span>relatively less emphasis has been placed on the ma- terial inducements associated with the party. Financial incentives for party participation are widely discussed in the literature on authoritarian political mobilization.

As a result, Iraqis typically joined the party either because of their commitment to the ideology or for the perquisites.<span class="s19">86 </span>Faust writes, for example, that while Iraqis affiliated with the party for a variety of reasons, it was particularly important that the party “controlled access to academic, professional, economic, and social opportunity.”<span class="s19">87</span></p><p style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Some scholars have estimated that up to two-thirds of Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party mem-</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">bers were government employees.<span class="s19">88 </span>Prospective party members had to fill out extensive background questionnaires to confirm suitability; indeed, the Iraq Memory Foundation collection contains thousands of Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party membership applications. Employees of the state sector—like teachers and bureaucrats—were almost universally Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party members as the regime had strong incentives to ensure that young Iraqis were influenced by party stalwarts. And, all else equal, party membership helped people obtain promo- tions.<span class="s19">89 </span>But joining the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party was not a mere formality as it implied a long-term commitment.

The final column of </a>table 7.2 provides the percentage of active members to supporters, a summary statistic which indicates the relative proportion of high-ranking party participants to low-ranking party participants, by governorate. Governorates in the Iraqi South, like Basra and Dhi Qar, are very low on this indicator, suggesting that although these areas have large numbers of supporters, very few individuals are willing or able to reach the higher echelons of the party apparatus. Salah al-Din, on the other hand, has a very large number of active members relative to supporters, as do Anbar and Diyala, the other governorates of the “central” administrative area of Iraq.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">These observations are consistent with findings of scholars seeking to understand regional and sectarian representation in the leadership structure of the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party.

In the Iraqi context, the “friend of the president” status served as a broad-based benefits designator. Although the benefits of “friend of the president” status were relatively modest, they could be meaningful particularly during the austerity of the sanctions period. In this section, I discuss regional variation in “friend of the president” status. I also investigate the relationship between “friend of the president” status and individual-level willingness to state an independent political identification.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Regional Variation in “Friend of the President” Status</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">According to Khoury, the “friend of the president” status “brought soldiers, clan leaders, martyrs, Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists, and bureaucrats together under a category</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">112.

Science students are also statistically more likely to enjoy the “friend of the president” status.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The second model considers the same baseline regression but also includes a covariate for whether or not the student’s first-degree relative (i.e., father or brother) was killed in either the Iran-Iraq War or Gulf War. In this specification, having a war martyr in the family is a highly significant predictor of “friend of the president” status; “friend of the president” designation is also increasing in percentage Sunni and for science students, while it is decreasing</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">In the Baghdad sample, about 1.6 percent of students are identified as Kurdish. The other minority groups identified in the Registers (including Assyrian, Chaldean Christian, and Armenian) were considerably smaller. Students in Baghdad were also fairly equally divided be- tween students on the literature (31 percent), science (40 percent), and vocational (29 percent) tracks.</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark194">for Kurds. The third specification considers the correlates of “friend of the president” status with the inclusion of a district-level wealth index. District- level wealth is positively associated with “friend of the president” status; after controlling for wealth, Kurdish remains negatively associated with “friend of the president” status, while percentage Sunni and science track are positively associated with the designation.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Political Orientation and “Friend of the President” Status</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: right;"><a href="#bookmark195" class="s13">What impact did “friend of the president” status have on political orientation? I was able to conduct analysis on the political orientation for high school stu- dents from Baghdad for the 2001–2002 academic year; in that sample, about 13 percent of high school students said that they were political independents. </a>Table 7.5 presents the results of a logistic regression where the outcome variable is coded as “1” if a student self-identified as politically independent. The results from Model 7.8 suggest that the percentage Sunni has a strong, positive association on being politically independent as does Kurdish iden- tity. Literature and science students are also more likely to be politically independent relative to vocational students. Model 7.9 replicates the regres- sion with the same set of covariates and adds the student’s “friend of the president” status. The signs and substantive significance on the covariates remain largely unchanged from Model 7.8; “friend of the president” status is strongly negatively correlated with political independent orientation. In other words, individuals with this status were less likely to express an independent orientation, after controlling for other factors. This is perhaps not surprising since “friend of the president” status would have invested individuals in the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">regime.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">I am also able to estimate how the proportion of other politically indepen- dent students within a school impacted the likelihood of a particular student declaring himself to be politically independent. In other words, this analysis allows me to see if there are agglomeration effects associated with political behaviors, like self-stated Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist or independent political orientation. Model</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">7.10 suggests similar patterns as reported previously and adds the very strong correlation between a particular individual’s political orientation and the percentage of students in one’s school who also self-identify as independent. This result is consistent with the idea that one’s assessment of the regime is conditional, to some degree, on the assessment of others.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p

I also provide some information about the majority-minority sectarian identification for each tribe. I have attempted to code for the predominant sectarian identity, where possible.

Hassan (2007, 1) finds that about 75 percent of the total Iraqi population are members of a tribe or have kinship to a tribe. Tribes in Iraq vary considerably in size. While the largest of Iraq’s tribes numbers more than one million, the smallest have only thousands of members; there are approximately 150 major tribes in Iraq which are composed of about 2,000 smaller clans (Hassan 2007, 1). The most common non-tribal names from the list include Muhammad, Ali, Hussein, Abbas, Abdallah, and Ahmed, which indicate little about family origin.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark197">There are over 600 individuals with the family name Juburi who appear on the list, for example. The Jubur tribe is a predominantly Sunni tribe with a strong presence in the area just north of Tikrit in central Iraq. One scholar who interviewed members of the Jubur tribe found that they were often recruited into intelligence agencies where they had the opportunity to go from relative poverty to lives of considerable influence in Baghdad with extensive opportunities for personal enrichment.</a><span class="s19">123 </span>The results of my analysis suggest that tribesmen from the Jubur tribe were over-represented in the set of individuals who received special distinction by the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">I also find overrepresentation of Sunni-majority relative to Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i-majority tribes in this list. In addition, of the predominantly Sunni tribes that do appear to be most represented, half of those tribes are geographically proximate to Tikrit.<span class="s19">124 </span>This evidence supports the idea that Sunnis from the areas in and around Tikrit enjoyed high status and reward within the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime, even relative to other Sunnis, including those from western Iraq.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">conclusions</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party began as a small political party with its roots in a postcolonial wave of Arab nationalism and state-driven solutions to economic underdevel- opment.

As citizens became less invested in the regime, which seemed highly vulnerable to overthrow, the party was relatively unsuccessful at enforcing compliance, particulary for young Iraqis. Over time, however, with increasing state recon- solidation, the Ba</a><span class="s18">c</span>th Party was able to reassert itself.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In this chapter, I have sought to demonstrate that support for the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party was contextual, influenced by individual identity and status within the regime as well as broader changes over time in the political environment. Using data from a variety of archival sources, I am able to empirically identify the geographic regions with the greatest concentration of party-distributed benefits. One way to encourage greater investment in the regime was through the distribution of honorifics, which afforded distinction holders special priv- ileges and perquisites. The “friend of the president” status—which provided privileges and handouts—was enjoyed by many Iraqis and particularly those from the central provinces of Iraq. Even higher-order benefits associated with the Ba<span class="s18">c</span><a href="#bookmark115" class="s13">th Party disproportionately went to individuals who came from the geographic regions closest to Tikrit—the hometown of Saddam Hussein. These findings are broadly consistent with the evidence presented in </a>chapter 5 which suggested that despite the conventional characterization of Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist Iraq as a “Sunni” regime, there existed important distributional disparities both within the Sunni community as well as across ethno-sectarian communities.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The evidence presented in this chapter also speaks to the meaningful forms of public, political non-compliance undertaken by Iraqis. On the one hand, I show that large numbers of Iraqi students from across the country stated that they had a Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist political orientation. Regional and temporal variation in self-stated Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist political orientation must be understood in its political context, however. Before the 1991 Uprisings, Iraqis from a variety of backgrounds could withhold their support for the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party; during that time, choosing to identify as a political independent might serve as a public signal of dissatisfaction with the regime. Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist identification declined as citizens downgraded their assessment of the regime as well as their expectation that the regime would survive. By the late Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist period, however, the regime was able to invest in a core of party supporters who were able to enforce public cooperation on large segments of the population; in the early 2000s, only western Sunnis had the ability and incentive to withdraw public support for the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark199">C H A P T E R 8</a><a name="bookmark200">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">RUMORS AS RESISTANCE</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Individuals living under the control of authoritarian regimes engage in a variety of survival strategies. Among those strategies are attempts to gather information which might provide one with an economic advantage or critical information to guide one’s activities in an uncertain and fast-changing security situation. In other cases, information disseminated person-to-person offers critiques of political figures or allows individuals to coordinate forms of anti- regime political behavior. Yet central to the objectives of the most controlling political regimes is the desire to maintain a monopoly over information. This chapter describes a quietly subversive form of political behavior—the circulation of rumors.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The Iraqi regime collected and catalogued rumors that circulated, many of which were explicitly political in content. Yet even private communica- tion that did not explicitly criticize the regime enjoyed a political quality because of the regime’s desire to control information. A core argument of this chapter is that even rumors intended to assist an individual in day- to-day survival are regime-undermining because they break the regime’s monopolistic control on relevant information. Hussein’s regime had totalitar- ian aspirations, but never fully succeeded in totalizing forms of social control, as evidenced by the failure to quiet society’s private communications.<span class="s19">1</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l106"><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">While this chapter focuses on rumors as collected by the Ba<span class="s21">c</span>thist regime, the regime also made strategic use of rumors. Khoury (2013, 66) writes about how party cadre were trained to disseminate some rumors and combat others during the Iran-Iraq War. Sassoon (2011, 84) also writes that the regime was known to spread rumors (and counter-rumors), particularly in northern Iraq. The analysis in this chapter focuses on the 1990s and early 2000s, a time during which there is less evidence for the instrumental use of rumors by the regime. Indeed, during this time, a major preoccupation of the region was with reading political trends within society rather than trying to influence those trends. See Sassoon and Dimitrov (2014) for more on how rumors were an important source of information to the regime about people’s feelings on various issues.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark201">I argue that under dictatorship, rumors can represent a narrow but relatively safe space for discourse. DiFonzo and Bordia define rumors as “unverified and instrumentally relevant information statements in circulation that arise in contexts of ambiguity, danger, or potential threat that function to help people make sense and manage risk.”</a><span class="s19">2 </span>For Kapferer, rumors are “the media of what goes unsaid: they allow one to bring up in public subjects that the political tradition forbids one to mention openly.”<span class="s19">3 </span>Private discourse about what would otherwise be publicly unspeakable depends on the existence of both interpersonal trust and social cohesion.

For Scott, slander constitutes one of the weapons available as part of peasant resistance.<span class="s19">5 </span>In authoritarian Syria, Wedeen argues that “resistance is made up primarily of mundane transgressions that do not aim to overthrow the existing order.”<span class="s19">6 </span>Given the increasing impossibility of direct political critique, the circulation of rumors, many of which worked against the regime’s desired monopoly on information and discourse, served to undermine the objectives of the Iraqi regime.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">This chapter has three key objectives. The first is to demonstrate the utility of looking at rumors as a manifestation of the “hidden transcript” of political resistance in autocratic regimes.<span class="s19">7 </span>Second, using an original collection of over 2,000 rumors gathered from the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist files from the 1990s and early 2000s, I find that rumors appear to have been highly concentrated in Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i areas.

Davis (2005, 17) argues that even in the most oppressive regimes, subaltern groups can resist forms of authority through the use of “historical metaphor” in discourse that challenges power structures indirectly.

I also find that rumors followed particular patterns of diffusion, commonly between the Euphrates region (home to the Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i Shrine Cities of Najaf and Karbala) and Baghdad. Third, this chapter provides evidence that during periods of political uncertainty—often related to Iraq’s external relations—rumors sought to coordinate forms of anti-regime sabotage and subversive political behavior. The vast majority of these anti-regime behaviors were rumored to have taken place or expected to occur in Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i neighborhoods and regions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">rumors and authoritarianism</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Rumors are often multi-functional for citizens of authoritarian regimes, providing critical forms of information to individuals seeking strategies for survival in high-risk political environments while simultaneously reflecting and encouraging forms of interpersonal trust between individuals through their safe transmission. Rumors often also reflect forms of political subver- sion and attempts to mobilize citizens collectively. If rumors serve different functions, their existence in a society also reflects multiple layers of political meaning. In this section, I discuss the existing literature on rumors, particu- larly as applied to the study of authoritarian regimes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Deﬁning Rumor</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Rumors, particularly those circulating in advanced industrial democracies, have long been a subject of study in social psychology. Rosnow and Kimmel define a rumor as “an unverified proposition or belief that bears topical relevance for persons actively involved in its dissemination.”<span class="s19">8 </span>Slightly mod- ified, Fine defines rumor as “an expression of a belief of topical rele- vance that is spread without secure standards of evidence, given norms for beliefs.”<span class="s19">9 </span>At their core, most definitions of rumor build upon the character- istics outlined by Knapp, who focuses on the relevant informational quality and word-of-mouth transmission of rumors.<span class="s19">10</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rosnow and Kimmel 2000, 122. 9.

Rumors are often widely disseminated, but with no commonly known source.<span class="s19">12 </span>Because of this, the speaker of the rumor is able to distance himself from the content, diverting responsibility from the reporter to the unknown source.<span class="s19">13 </span>This allows for a degree of anonymity of attribution that is particularly important if a rumor conveys politically subversive or controversial themes.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">How can rumors be differentiated from other forms of informal informa- tion transmission? As suggested, rumors relate to subjects of significance as opposed to gossip, which typically relates to subjects of limited significance.<span class="s19">14 </span>Rumor might be further differentiated from myth or legend given the fact that it is topical in nature.<span class="s19">15 </span>Rumors are also differentiated from news, in that news is (supposedly) verified.<span class="s19">16</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Rumors often arise when information is highly valued, but its quality tends to be poor. Perice argues that rumors are likely to emerge “in violent and dangerous situations.”<span class="s19">17 </span>Viola describes the case of the proliferation of rumors in Soviet peasant communities during Stalin’s rule.<span class="s19">18 </span>She finds that when confronted with the threat of major economic, political, and social change, rumors were “omnipresent” in the “propitious climate of fear and upheaval.”<span class="s19">19 </span>Information collected in such contexts not only has the potential to be actionable, but can also assist in reducing anxiety by helping individuals make sense of disruptive and uncertain situations.<span class="s19">20</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The most influential work on the social psychology of rumor emerged in response to the widespread circulation of rumors in western democracies, like the United States, during World War II. Knapp, for example, developed an influential, three-type classification scheme for rumors—(1) the wish, or pipe-dream rumor; (2) the fear, or bogey, rumor; and (3) the wedge-driving,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;">Bordia and DiFonzo, 2004.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Perice 1997. 13.

While wish rumors express the hopes of the people circulating the rumor (“there will be a revolution in Germany before the summer”), the fear rumor expresses citizen anxiety (“the entire Pacific Fleet was destroyed at Pearl Harbor”).<span class="s19">21 </span>Wedge-driving rumors seek to create disunity and to sow animosity across and between societal groups (“the Catholics in America are trying to evade the draft”). While Knapp’s three- type classification provides a parsimonious and analytically useful scheme for categorizing rumors in the context of the United States during World War II, different social and political contexts require a reconsideration of the political role of rumors.<span class="s19">22</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Private Communication in Autocratic Regimes</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Rumors play a special role under autocratic regimes that gives their circulation a political relevance perhaps even greater than during periods of war in democ- racies. While rumors can spread quickly and easily in free societies, rumors circulating in autocratic contexts tend to spread slowly, but often include more valuable information. As information repression increases, rumors become more valuable, in part, because the costs of their circulation are so high. In this section, I discuss the political relevance of rumor under conditions of autocracy with particular attention to issues of government information control, the relationship between rumor circulation and inter- personal trust, and rumor as a tool of political resistance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Information Control</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Rumors often serve to fill an informational void when other forms of infor- mation are not credible or available, as is commonly the case in authoritarian regimes.<span class="s19">23 </span>In the context of a highly censored authoritarian regime, all “news” emanates from the state sector and is highly propagandistic in nature.

Private information is also often highly valuable in authoritarian contexts because an individual’s political choices frequently reflect high-stakes calculations where one might be forced into action with only limited information.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Rumors can circulate even when levels of political repression are high. For example, in authoritarian Haiti, repression meant that open public debate was not possible, leading to a proliferation of “back-alley rumors.”<span class="s19">24 </span>Indeed, rumors pose particular challenges for authoritarian regimes, even when states enjoy a relatively high capacity for surveillance. Scott writes that “part of the relative immunity of the spoken word from surveillance springs from its low technological level.”<span class="s19">25 </span>Word-of-mouth communications are hard to link to a particular source and are more difficult to shut down than a printing press. Rumor, then, enjoys a kind of “double utility” as both an alternative public sphere to the one encouraged by the state while simultaneously serving as a form of discourse protected from the repressive force that may have destroyed the public sphere, in most cases a repressive authoritarian regime.<span class="s19">26</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In a study of Soviet life under Stalin, Bauer and Gleicher make extensive use of reports from refugee informants who state that much of their information about events and policies came from unofficial channels.<span class="s19">27 </span>Indeed, word-of- mouth communication was highly important under Stalin, with 50 percent of subjects citing it as a regular source of information and 33 percent as their most important information source.<span class="s19">28 </span>The importance of unofficial, word-of-mouth communications undermined the “essential premise of Soviet communications policy . . . the principle of monopoly.”<span class="s19">29 </span>Soviet media was organized and highly controlled; indeed, severe punishments were common for individuals who circulated prohibited material or anti-regime, political jokes.

In this section, I will address three aspects of trust with respect to the concept in an authoritarian context: institutional trust, inter- personal trust, and trust within and between groups.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Rumors tend to proliferate in settings with low levels of institutional trust.<span class="s19">30 </span>When organizations, particularly those that exert forms of political and social power, are not trusted by members of society, individuals turn to one another for vital information. The need for information may be intensified by the existence of poor-quality or politicized “facts” associated with regime propaganda efforts. When so-called authoritative sources—like state-run media—are “incomplete or inaccurate,” rumor proliferates.<span class="s19">31 </span>Yet even in settings where trust between individuals and institutions is low, if the cost of transmitting rumors becomes too high, individuals will be reluctant to engage in non-official forms of communication.<span class="s19">32</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The emergence of rumor does not just reflect a generalized breakdown in institutional trust, however, but also reflects and encourages the building of trust between individuals. According to Fine, “rumor both derives from and contributes to the social organization of trust.”<span class="s19">33 </span>In other words, breakdown in institutional trust can lead citizens to develop forms of interpersonal trust as part of efforts to seek out critical forms of information.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">There are a number of reasons why interpersonal trust matters in rumor transmission. One is that in dictatorships, rumormongering is often crimi- nalized, particularly if the information being transmitted hurts the regime or national reputation. A second reason is that judgments about information quality may be correlated with the level of trust one has in the individual transmitting the rumor. Third, individuals who transmit rumors often offer their interpretation and contextualization of the information.<span class="s19">34 </span>Scott writes that “as a rumor travels it is altered in a fashion that brings it more closely</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">30.

In particular, divisive or wedge-driving rumors can discourage trust between demographically distinct groups while, in some cases, helping to build solidarity within other groups. Within their communities, then, rumors represent an updating of the group’s collective memory and beliefs.<span class="s19">36 </span>Societies in which tension or mistrust between groups exists are more susceptible to divisive rumors.<span class="s19">37</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Guha’s scholarly work on colonial India reflects all three aspects of the relationship between rumor and trust.<span class="s19">38 </span>In particular, Guha writes about how rumors were instrumental in spurring the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857. Rumors regarding the British use of lard-greased cartridges triggered widespread panic by the largely Hindu, vegetarian population. Guha writes, “unfounded and unverifiable reports about greased cartridges, flour polluted by bone meal, and forcible conversion to Christianity . . . about issues touching on indige- nous sentiment at profound depths merged into ‘one gigantic rumour’ and transformed the many disparate elements of popular grievance against the Raj into a war of sepoys and peasants.”<span class="s19">39 </span>In this setting, the impulse to pass on a rumor reflected an interpersonal bond where the communal quality of rumor transmission accounts for the rapid speed with which rumors spread. According to Guha, “rumour proved to be a powerful vehicle of the hopes and fears, or visions of doomsdays and golden ages, of secular objectives and religious longings, all of which made up the stuff that fired the minds of men.”<span class="s19">40</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">35.

One might think that if a rumor does not turn out to be true that this might decrease an individual’s trust in the person sharing information. It is important, however, to distinguish between trust in the quality of information being shared versus interpersonal trust. Rumors that are not realized as fact would decrease trust in the rumormonger as a credible source for information, but would not necessarily undermine interpersonal trust between the individuals.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">38.

Fine describes rumor as a “form of political discourse” that “critiques the social order.”<span class="s19">41 </span>As a result, he suggests that analysis of rumor should be studied as part of the “sociology of action.”<span class="s19">42 </span>In addition, a rich literature on the “arts of resistance” suggests that rumor reflects the aspirations for political change felt by repressed groups.<span class="s19">43 </span>Scott writes that “oppressed groups so often read in rumors promises of their imminent liberation . . . a powerful and suppressed desire for relief from the burdens of subordination.”<span class="s19">44 </span>Rumor may also be a tool of political mobilization as “the autonomy and volatility of politically charged rumor can easily spark violent acts.”<span class="s19">45 </span>Guha goes as far as to argue that rumor is a “universal and necessary carrier of insurgency in any pre-industrial, pre-literate society.”<span class="s19">46 </span>And rumormongering itself, even on topics unrelated to political life, often entails forms of political risk that politicize the very act of private communication.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Viola’s research on peasant rebellions under Stalin points to the use of</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">rumor as facilitating resistance.<span class="s19">47 </span>Rumors in Stalin’s Russia served as “a form of underground news and dissident social expression.”<span class="s19">48 </span>Viola describes rumor as “intrinsically subversive” since political discussion of the state or its associated organs might create opportunities for anti-regime mobilization.<span class="s19">49 </span>As a result, rumors in that setting served as much more than a survival strategy for the economically oppressed; they directly challenged the dictatorship while simultaneously encouraging forms of political mobilization.

In 1987, Hussein, in a conversation with Ali Hassan al-Majid and other insiders, boasted that he did not need to rely on the intelligence services because the citizens of Iraq provided him with such good information about everything going on within Iraqi society.<span class="s19">51 </span>By 1990, Hussein and top party cadre appeared to have grown more concerned about information control and the issue of societal rumors.<span class="s19">52 </span>One regime insider suggested that the party had failed to do its job properly since rumors were rife and spreading rapidly both in Baghdad and elsewhere in the country. In response, party officials discussed implementing a more rigorous reporting regimen.<span class="s19">53</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The issue of how the regime should deal with rumors became particularly salient after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and in the run-up to the Gulf War. In another meeting, Hussein referenced a Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party manual on how to deal with rumors, suggesting the need to upgrade party protocols.<span class="s19">54 </span>Speaking angrily, Hussein criticized his associates for their organizational failures in this regard. The need to refute rumors was also considered important as rumors were seen as a form of demoralizing sabotage that should be dealt with most seriously.<span class="s19">55</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Rumormongering was criminalized in Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist Iraq given the regime’s desire to control the spread of information. Individuals could be arrested and jailed if they were found to be spreading rumors.<span class="s19">56 </span>Even small indiscretions could lead one to become the subject of regime repression.

Rumors can be seen as an “index” of public morale,<span class="s19">61 </span>revealing a great deal about the fears, hopes, and insecurities of people. In addition to serving as a general barometer of public sentiment, rumors serve as an important source of information about citizen attitudes toward the regime, in particular.<span class="s19">62 </span>In addition, the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime had a strong incentive to receive early warning about communal violence or anti-regime political mobilization.<span class="s19">63</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party officials were concerned with the destabilizing effects of rumor- mongering as rumors could harm the objectives of the regime. But what do we know about the content of rumors circulating between citizens in autocratic Iraq? And to what extent does the content of the rumors speak to concerns of particular ethno-sectarian groups within Iraq? Rumors collected by the regime covered a diversity of subjects; despite the multiplicity of topics discussed, it is still possible to identify some high-frequency categories.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The vast majority of rumors circulating in Iraq during the 1990s and early 2000s relate to a series of high-relevance, substantive topics. This includes rumors on issues like protest behavior, targeted killings, and military</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">58.

One method by which this could happen was described as through rumormongering. See CRRC Doc. No. SH-SSOX-D- 000-869, January 1992 to March 1993.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">Knapp 1944.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;">Sassoon 2011.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Anthropologists, for example, have also written extensively about the way that rumors can mobilize communal violence, particularly in ethnically divided societies (Bubandt 2008).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark206">mobilization in the face of impending or anticipated conflict. Rumors describing attacks against Ba</a><span class="s18">c</span>th Party members were common during the 1990s. For example, almost three dozen rumors report assassination attempts against high-level Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party and government officials. Information regarding military mobilizations, military service, and pardons as well as high-level defections remained important for large numbers of Iraqi citizens. As a result, it is perhaps not surprising that rumors about the military proliferated. Concerns about pending mobilizations and pardons for desertion would have been of particularly high salience for Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Perhaps more so than any other category of rumor, rumors about protest reflect a desire to coordinate political behavior. About 6 percent involved a specific call to action—half of which reflect explicitly anti-regime mobi- lization with the other half more ambiguous regarding the target of the coordinated political act. A relatively large percentage of these rumors relate to protests to take place in southern provinces and the Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i slums of Baghdad. This trend is consistent with my empirical expectation that Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a enjoyed interpersonal trust at the group level. Almost no rumors reflected pro-regime forms of mobilization.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In this section, I summarize some of the main subjects covered in the rumors and discuss their political implications. The rumors I discuss represent an illustrative set of topics circulating in Iraqi society.<span class="s19">64</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Military Mobilizations</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Rumors about military mobilizations are one of the largest topics of discussion within the files. These topics are relevant for the entire Iraqi population but can be thought to have a particular salience for Iraq Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a who have historically been drafted into military service at high rates and, during the course of service, are disproportionately injured or killed in conflict. In the fall of 1997, a number of rumors circulated about a call for all men born after 1959 to enter military service; a rumor the following month suggested that men born in 1962, 1968, 1969, and 1970 would all be called to military service in anticipation of a US attack on Iraq.<span class="s19">65 </span>It was suggested around that time that</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Some rumors also reflect forms of political confusion in Iraq’s low information environment.</p></li></ol><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">65.

For example, in 1999 rumors suggested that men born in the 1960s would be enlisted to counter an attack from Iran.<span class="s19">67 </span>Preparatory and higher education students were expected to serve three years instead of the customary eighteen months, according to another rumor, with students moving through the following progression—one year in service to Saddam Hussein, the second year pursuing higher education, and the final year in mandatory military service.<span class="s19">68 </span>Later that year, it was rumored that a war against Iran and against targets in the North would take place and that the Iraqi army was gathering on the country’s eastern border.<span class="s19">69</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The previous examples place Iraq as the target of a rumored attack, requir- ing a defensive military mobilization. There also were a number of rumors suggesting that the Iraqi regime was initiating a military aggression itself. In January 1993, Hussein was rumored to have sent threatening messages to then-Emir of Kuwait Jaber al-Sabah, insinuating that Kuwait no long enjoyed the protection of foreign actors.<span class="s19">70 </span>Around the same time, it was also rumored that Hussein would bomb Kuwait City and Israel.<span class="s19">71 </span>In 1997, multiple rumors suggested that the Iraqi government had installed missiles near the border with Kuwait and that Iraq was prepared to attack Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Israel.<span class="s19">72 </span>Hosni Mubarak was reported to be mediating between Iraq and Kuwait in order to solve the diplomatic crisis.<span class="s19">73 </span>Shortly thereafter, it was reported that a large gathering of Iraqi forces was preparing to enter Kuwait, that the United States was searching for ten transcontinental missiles Iraq</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">66.

As a result, a great deal of attention was paid to rumors about pardons for desertion from military service or other blanket amnesties that might be offered.

At the same time, the increasing intensity of punishment meted out at Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i populations after the 1991 Uprisings encouraged individuals with grievances to engage in private rather than public forms of political non-compliance. Taken together, these arguments are associated with the empirical prediction that after 1991, Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a would be engaged in rumormongering to a greater extent than other Iraqis.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Figure 8.1 displays the geographic distribution of rumors taking into account the population of each region.<span class="s19">96 </span>In the cross-section, a number of patterns emerge. First, the total number of rumors collected in the North and Central regions—which are primarily Sunni—was relatively small. Instead, areas with large or predominantly Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a populations, like the South and the Euphrates regions, tend to have large numbers of per capita rumors. Baghdad is also a major location of rumor circulation, perhaps not surprising given its density. The population of Baghdad has been estimated at two-thirds Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i and one-third Sunni during the period under study.<span class="s19">97</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">I cannot rule out the possibility that rumormongering was always higher in Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i regions of Iraq compared to other parts of the country as I do not have data from the period before 1991. I am also not able to rule out that the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party was more interested in collecting rumors in Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i areas compared to other areas of the country. Yet, the documentary evidence suggests that the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party had a strong incentive to collect information from across Iraq. The patterns that I observe are consistent with my theoretical arguments and had I observed a different empirical pattern, my expectation could have been refuted.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Patterns of Rumors Circulation</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A second, related implication is that rumors will circulate more easily with and across areas with higher levels of interpersonal trust.

What constitutes a repeated rumor? I draw on the literature associated with event history analysis to develop a coding strategy. In that literature, news headlines are parsed to include information about a subject, action, and object of the action. In analyzing the Iraqi rumors, I code a rumor as repeated if it meets two criteria—first, it shares either a subject-action, subject-object, or action-object with another rumor and, second, the two rumors occur within a span of three months. Because rumors are transmitted via private communications, I allowed the coding criteria to incorporate a degree of fluidity in the content of the information. In most cases, rumors that I code as repeated have considerable overlap in content and repeat multiple times.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">What do these repeated rumors look like in practice? Consider three examples. In July 1999, a rumor circulated that the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party released bags of diseased rats and mice in the predominantly Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i Saddam City neighborhood of Baghdad to spread cholera in that area with the goal of encouraging people to move out of the neighborhood.<span class="s19">98 </span>The following month, rumors about the disease-ridden rats in Saddam City continued.<span class="s19">99 </span>A second example is drawn from May 2000 when it was rumored that the mythical “sword of Ali” had been seen in a Baghdad neighborhood.<span class="s19">100 </span>Five days later it was rumored that a shining light in the shape of the sword of Ali had appeared in the garden of a house in that same neighborhood and that the owner of that house had been arrested by security officials.<span class="s19">101 </span>Two days after that, another rumor suggested that the sword of Ali had appeared in that area.<span class="s19">102 </span>A third example of a repeated rumor circulated in August 2000 when it was reported that the price of sugar would be increasing from 400 to 850 Iraqi dinars and that the share distributed in the rations program would be halved.<span class="s19">103 </span>Four days later, it was rumored that the month’s sugar share had not been distributed and this is why sugar prices were rising.<span class="s19">104</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The most common locations for the occurrence of repeated rumors were between (1) Baghdad, the Euphrates region, and the South; and (2) between</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">98.

Baghdad-South is the third most likely pattern for repeated rumors. Interestingly, Euphrates-South is less common, suggesting the centrality of Baghdad as a locus for rumor transmittal. It is not possible to rule out that these rumors were arising independently.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The “directionality” of the rumors, or what can be inferred about the geographic spread of the rumors based on when and where each rumor was reported, is another quantity of interest. For rumors circulating between the Euphrates region and Baghdad, the rumors were equally likely to have first been reported in either area. But for rumors that appeared in Baghdad, the Euphrates region, and the South, they are much more likely to have started in either Baghdad or the Euphrates region, later traveling to the South. Upon reviewing rumors that were repeated in the Euphrates region and the South, three-quarters began in the Euphrates area. What implications might we draw from these patterns? Urban, Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i networks appear to be particularly dense locations for informal information transmissions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Rumors and Political Crisis</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Periods of heightened engagement with international actors were potentially vulnerable times for the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime. To what extent did anti-regime activists seek to undermine the state during these periods? And did Iraq’s engagement with external actors create opportunities for coordinated action against regime interests? In this section, I explore the nature of rumormonger- ing at different points in time with the goal of understanding how subversive activities may have been encouraged by periods of political crisis.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">To do this, I examine the political circumstances and circulating rumors surrounding a handful of high-profile events, including confrontations with the United States in 1993, 1996, and 1998. I find that periods of political crisis tended to be accompanied by an increasing number of rumors that sought to coordinate acts of sabotage against the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime, suggesting the instrumental identification of such moments as an opportunity for anti- regime behaviors. The vast majority of rumored anti-regime activities are anticipated in Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i majority areas.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Empirical analysis of these temporal trends is challenging, however, because of gaps in my ability to find files for all time periods as well as the fact that rumors both preview impending crises and reflect past events, influencing the number and content of rumors in any given period. While the pattern</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark215">I observe does not demonstrate a causal link between crises and anti-regime Shi</a><span class="s18">c</span>i mobilization, it is consistent with the intuition that crises of this sort were coordinating events for anti-regime activists. For periods of time where my data are more dense, I am able to offer comparisons in the intensity of rumors between periods with and without crises.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">One period of crisis that offers a different empirical pattern is the one leading up to the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. During this period, the near inevitability of Hussein’s forced removal by external actors decreased the incentive for anti-regime activists to engage in politically subversive behavior. Instead, rumors in the second half of 2002 focused on the distributive policies of the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime as it sought to shore up support among Iraqis in advance of the US invasion.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Invasion of Kuwait and Wartime Uncertainty, 1990</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A number of rumors cluster temporally around the time of the Gulf War. Some of these rumors reflected citizen uncertainty about anticipated events, while others suggested public attempts to coordinate behaviors that might make a US invasion less likely. In some cases, citizens sought to convince Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait before a foreign invasion would occur. The issue of the Iraqi presence in Kuwait, as well as cross-border tension with Kuwait, had large implications for all of Iraq’s population; but because of the large number of Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i Iraqis in the armed forces as well as the proximity of Kuwait to the southern, predominately Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i parts of Iraq, Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a had a particularly high stake in a peaceful resolution to the crisis in Kuwait.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">For example, in September 1990 rumors circulated about a possible Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.<span class="s19">105 </span>The rumors suggested that government officials were asking Hussein to voluntarily depart Kuwait.<span class="s19">106 </span>There were also rumors that a referendum would take place for Iraqi citizens to weigh in on whether Kuwait should remain part of Iraq or not.<span class="s19">107 </span>One rumor stated that refer- endum forms had been distributed in Sulaymaniyya and that social pressure</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">105.

The use of a slogan suggesting Iraqis supported Saddam Hussein and that support for the president was not conditional on maintaining control of Kuwait may have been a bid to appeal to Hussein’s ego and to give him a face- saving way to pull out of Kuwait. These rumors circulated at a time when some elites within Washington, DC—like Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, William Webster—were suggesting an immediate military attack should Hussein fail to withdraw from Kuwait while others—like Republican Senator Bob Dole—argued that restoring the Kuwaiti Emir to his throne was not worth the lives of American soldiers.<span class="s19">119 </span>After the resolution of the 1990–1991 conflict, rumors about Kuwait persisted, particularly about the relationship between Kuwait and Iraq and often in association with discussion about the role of third-party actors, like the United States.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;text-align: justify;">Showdown with the United States over Southern No-Fly Zone, 1993</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The first half of 1993 saw the circulation of a number of rumors which reflected the extreme political uncertainty of that period.

During the first six months of 2000, for example, rumors continued to spread about anti-regime collective mobilization, but far fewer than during the first half of 1999. When rumors about anti-regime activities did appear during the first half of 2000, they were focused on disruptions in Saddam City and Najaf, both predominantly Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i areas.<span class="s19">218</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the Run-Up to War, 2002</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In the years leading up to the US invasion of Iraq, political conditions were challenging for the regime, with threats emanating from a variety of different actors. Violence—both on the part of the regime as well as against the regime—was frequently rumored. In particular, rumors about the impending US invasion were common. As a US invasion became more and more of an inevitability, there appeared relatively few rumors about anti-regime collective mobilization. This empirical pattern is distinct from the other periods of political crisis that I have discussed. Rumors focused increasingly on payouts being offered by the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists to increase the regime’s popularity in the face of the US military action. By late 2002, the probability of Hussein’s removal from power seemed increasingly likely, reducing the incentive for individuals to mobilize before a US military action.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In June 2002, there did not yet exist a policy consensus within the Bush administration should options short of military invasion fail to dislodge Saddam Hussein from power.<span class="s19">219 </span>At that point in time, US discussions focused</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">216.

One rumor suggested that 500,000 Iraqi dinars would be given to each Iraqi family for which a political prisoner had not yet been released (BRCC Doc. No. 040-4-2-0048, November 2, 2002). Another rumor suggested that 3 million Iraqi dinars would go to each of the families of the executed (BRCC Doc. No. 040-4-2-0012, November 20, 2002). The idea that the regime sought to ingratiate itself with the families of political prisoners or those who had been executed suggests how widely the regime sought to gain support in the months before the US invasion.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark234">of the impending invasion and opportunities for last-minute payoffs from the regime.

I have sought to define rumors as a substantively useful area of research for understanding forms of political resistance in Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist Iraq. In particular, I have argued that the circulation of rumors in Iraq might be interpreted as a form of political non-compliance, even if those rumors did not directly criticize the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime. One reason for this is that the regime sought to maintain a monopoly on all forms of information—both political and non-political— thus rendering alternative communications a threat to this monopoly control.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">This interpretation of the political role of rumors is in line with scholarly research which suggests that rumors can have important effects on a popu- lation even if they are not believed or it cannot be known that they were believed.<span class="s19">258 </span>The content of the rumors themselves strongly challenges both the regime’s narrative as well as restrictions on anti-regime communications. Rumors that sought to mobilize acts of sabotage against regime targets were common during periods of international strife or domestic turmoil, a finding which suggests that Iraqis may have sought to use crisis moments instru- mentally to coordinate anti-regime behaviors. The uptick in rumors observed during moments of political crisis can be compared to non-crisis periods, which saw far fewer rumors seeking to mobilize activities against the regime. Whether or not rumored activities were true or attempts at coordination were acted upon, the rumors themselves provide evidence about attempts to subvert the regime. The period in the run-up to the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 serves as a noticeable exception to that trend. In late 2002, Iraqis</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Scott 1990.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">DiFonzo and Bordia 2007, 42.</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark235">probably thought Hussein would be deposed anyway, obviating the need for collective mobilization.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">From an empirical perspective, I find that rumors were numerically most common in Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i-majority parts of Iraq, including Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i neighborhoods in Baghdad. This finding is consistent with my theoretical expectation that Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a enjoyed higher levels of interpersonal trust than Iraqi Sunnis and, as a result, were better able to engage in forms of private communication. I also find that rumors often traveled in particular ways, for example between Baghdad and the Shrine Cities of the Euphrates region, and between Baghdad, the Euphrates region, and the southern region. In an examination of the substantive topics discussed in the rumors, I find the greatest density of discussion around issues with high salience for Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i communities, including those related to Iraq’s southern border, impending military mobilizations, and assassination plots targeting Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i clerical figures. Beyond the inferences I draw regarding the timing and geographic concentration of rumors, the content of the rumors themselves is deeply informative about the politics of everyday life in Iraq.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark236">C H A P T E R 9</a><a name="bookmark237">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: center;">RELIGION, IDENTITY, AND CONTENTIOUS POLITICS</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">John Nixon was the CIA’s top senior leadership analyst on Iraq. His job was to identify Iraq’s leading political and social actors and understand their personality traits and psychological motivations. According to Nixon, when Muhammad Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr—a grand ayatollah and Iraq’s leading Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i cleric—was assassinated in February 1999, the CIA scarcely knew who he was, let alone anything about his emerging network of followers.<span class="s19">1 </span>After the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, however, it became increasingly clear that a movement of Sadr followers was coalescing around his son—Muqtada al-Sadr. Although initially labeled a political lightweight, Muqtada al-Sadr’s loyal following and control over the powerful Mahdi Army—a Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i militia formed in the wake of the US invasion—made him an increasingly important player in a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq. In 2006, Nixon took the lead for the CIA on psychobiographical analysis of Muqtada al-Sadr. Nixon discovered that even three years into the war, the United States still barely knew anything about him or his political followers.<span class="s19">2</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">In this chapter, I examine the roots of various religious groups, including the Sadr movement, which originated during the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime. I argue that particular characteristics common to Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i religious organizations in Iraq made them relatively illegible to the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime and, in response, the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists turned to collective punishment of religious group members, which subsequently drove increased levels of group solidarity. The net result was the development of communal-level attachment organized around various clerical families within the Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i community rather than the emergence of pan-Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i solidarity.

Much of the existing literature on religion and politics during the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime focuses on Hussein’s motivation beginning in the 1990s for undertaking the so-called faith campaign—the promotion of a more religious and socially conservative agenda.<span class="s19">3 </span>My theoretical framework speaks to the issue of reli- gious organization and citizen behavior from a different angle. I discuss how the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists sought to both punish and penetrate religious groups targeted for monitoring. I also report findings from a nationwide census of clerics that focused on evaluating their loyalty to the regime. While the vast majority of clerics were deemed to be operating within acceptable parameters, some were under a greater cloud of suspicion than others. Finally, I discuss how, despite a massive regime investment in neutralizing the political power of religious organizations, religious group members continued to engage in transgressive behavior with implications for the types of religious identity groups to emerge in Iraq after the US invasion.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">religious organizations</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i religious organizations posed a particular legibility challenge for the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime. Thus far, I have argued that the preferences and political</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">3. Historically, the Ba<span class="s21">c</span>th Party had deployed mostly secular policies in the realms of criminal and family law. As a result, the policy shift in the 1990s has been deemed a change worth explaining. While some scholars have argued that Hussein himself was “in essence secular” and opposed politicization of religion by the state (Sassoon 2016, 56), others have suggested that Hussein had a personal religious epiphany that led him to change regime policies (Baram 2014). Nixon (2016) argues that Hussein was not hostile to religion itself but sought complete control over religious activity within Iraq. Helfont (2014) writes that although the Ba<span class="s21">c</span>th Party cooperated with Islamists abroad, this was only because this cooperation would be advantageous to the regime. There is no evidence that Hussein or the Ba<span class="s21">c</span>thist regime more generally displayed any sympathy for Islamism, Salafism, or Wahhabism; in fact, it appeared that Hussein had an aversion to any form of Islamization throughout his time in power, suggesting an instrumental regime motivation for the policy shift. See, for example, Samuel Helfont and Michael Brill, “Saddam’s ISIS? The Terrorist Group’s Real Origin Story,” <i>Foreign Affairs</i>, January 12, 2016.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark239">behaviors of Iraqi Shi</a><span class="s18">c</span>a were—on average—less legible to the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime since the core leadership and bureaucratic cadre for the party drew heavily from the Sunni areas in and around Tikrit, a location physically and socially distant from Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i population concentrations.

Part of the reason these networks historically have been dense is that the clerical establishment took actions to achieve their own transnational, professional objectives. Prominent clerics often operated in Farsi, or under strong influence from Iran, creating a barrier to regime penetration. Helfont argues that the transnational character of Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>ism was problematic for the regime as it was unable to monitor and control activities outside of its borders.<span class="s19">13</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Interpersonal ties within the community of religious scholars have also tended to be enduring.<span class="s19">14 </span>Kinship ties might bind together followers both within and across different religious allegiances. And teacher-disciple relations may be formalized through marital ties to reinforce existing networks.<span class="s19">15 </span>Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i clerics also “closely guard” their independence and are willing to make material and other sacrifices to maintain it.<span class="s19">16 </span>Strategies for funding clerical activities— through a system of tithing that exists separate from the state—limit the financial legibility of religious institutions from the perspective of the state.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l131"><li><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Aziz 2001, 140.

Clerics were responsible for providing guidance to members of the population during times of uncertainty. For example, in 1998 it was rumored that Muhammad Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr had issued a fatwa that imported medicine capsules should be emptied into water (rather than swallowed whole) since the exterior capsule was made from pig’s oil. In this instance, those individuals who viewed Sadiq al-Sadr as an exemplar of religious behavior would view his fatwa as providing appropriate guidance. See BRCC Doc. No. 087-5-3-0870, December 16, 1998 for a discussion about this incident.</p></li></ol><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">13.

The most promi- nent manifestation of this trend was the establishment of the Da<span class="s18">c</span>wa Party, or the Islamic “Call” Party. Established in the late 1950s, the Da<span class="s18">c</span>wa Party was created by a group of young Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i clerics from Najaf as a response to fears about the growing popularity of both Arab nationalism and Communist ideology.<span class="s19">19 </span>These Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i clergy were disheartened by declining numbers of religious pilgrims and smaller cohorts of seminary students, as well as a more generalized weakening of the hawza.<span class="s19">20 </span>Belonging to many of the prominent families that made up the Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i clerical establishment, the founders sought to complement, rather than compete with, traditional religious authorities.<span class="s19">21</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">Iraq’s traditional religious class viewed the growing strength of the state as detracting from their influence.<span class="s19">22 </span>Indeed, the Da<span class="s18">c</span>wa Party was created with the goal of Islamizing society and the state, similar to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.

According to Hiro, oppressive treatment of Da<span class="s18">c</span>wa Party activists was politically undesirable, encouraging Hussein to consider alternative approaches for managing the religious domain, including seeking out clerics sympathetic to the war cause while simultaneously “projecting himself as a pious Muslim.”<span class="s19">60</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Government documents promulgated just prior to the start of the Iran- Iraq War suggest the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party’s desire to engage more vigorously with religious elites, who were acknowledged as playing an influential societal role.

A recording from 1986 provides insight into Hussein’s perceptions about the increase in piety among Iraqis. From Hussein’s perspective, Islamist elites were not socially or politically innovative but had nonetheless benefited from a more general, generational shift toward religion. Hussein also suggested that the Ba<span class="s21">c</span>th Party had not been given sufficient credit for work it had done at the request of religious elites, including provision</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">of funding for the mentally ill and the poor.

For example, al-Khu’i refused to attend the Popular Islamic Conference held in Baghdad in 1983.</a><span class="s19">73 </span>Chubin and Tripp write that al-Khu’i “persistently refused to submit to the government’s demand that he make a pronouncement sanctioning the Iraqi war effort and condemning the Iranian regime . . . he has paid for this by being placed under virtual house arrest.”<span class="s19">74</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Hussein inferred dissent from within the clerical establishment when religious elites—like al-Khu’i—failed to make public statements in support of the war. Belonging to al-Khu’i’s network was not a condemnable offense in itself, however; indeed, the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party frequently sought to recruit and co-opt these individuals.<span class="s19">75 </span>At the same time, uncertainty about the loyalties of individuals within al-Khu’i’s circle meant that followers and students of the senior cleric were frequently arrested, or accused of supporting Iran, or the Da<span class="s18">c</span>wa Party.<span class="s19">76 </span>Even being born into a pious family could lead to arrest on suspicion of anti-regime activity.<span class="s19">77 </span>The regime was especially sensitive about reports that al-Khu’i was paying stipends to the families of students who failed to report to mandatory military service.<span class="s19">78</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">At various points during the 1980s, Hussein considered expelling the hawza altogether, taking complete state control of religious education and closing all religious schools.<span class="s19">79 </span>Such an action was rejected, however, in favor of a more measured approach. Arabization of the curriculum in Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i religious schools promoted the goal of reducing Persian influences<span class="s19">80 </span>and, perhaps, also increasing the legibility of such institutions. Hussein also eventually required that all religious institutions in Iraq use Arabic in the classroom, including for discussion materials, sermons, and evaluations.<span class="s19">81</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Regime control over visas for entrance into Iraq provided an opportunity to cut the number of foreign seminary students while simultaneously gaining leverage over those students since they depended on visa renewals for their</p><ol id="l136"><li><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Ibid., 63.

Nalepa and Pop-Eleches (2016) describe how Communist Party infiltration of the Catholic Church impacted social interactions in Eastern European contexts, like Poland.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark253"><span class="p">Many are described as “good” (</span></a>jayyid<span class="p">), meaning holding favorable—or at least acceptable—views toward the regime. Other individual clerics were described as “sound” (</span>salim<span class="p">). Two clerics in the collection were described as promi- nent (</span>bariz<span class="p">) and a small percentage were designated excellent (</span>mumtaz<span class="p">). 148 individuals were explicitly described as being collaborators (</span>mut<span class="s18">c</span>awin<span class="p">). Occasionally, individuals were described as nationalist (</span>watani<span class="p">).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Given the lack of consistent coding criteria applied by the party apparatchik to the evaluations, I only report the percentage of clerics who were described in a negative way, for example as “not good.” In Anbar, when clerics received a negative assessment, the terminology typically used was wavering or unsteady (<i>mudhabdhab</i>). Relatively few Anbari clerics were described as having a position in the party and those who did tended to be at a relatively low level of party advancement. While some clerics in Karbala were described as “good,” a common clerical designation was “no negative observation can be made about him for the time being” (<i>la mulahaza salbiya </i><span class="s18">c</span><i>alayhu fi al- waqt al-hadir</i>).<span class="s19">108 </span>Occasionally, clerics would also be described as cunning or underhanded (<i>murawigh</i>). In Najaf, a number of clerics are described as malicious or rancorous (<span class="s18">c</span><i>unsur haqid</i>).</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Although the different governorates were asked to report on the same categories, not all governorates provided complete information. In most governorates, information was provided about the party affiliation of clerics. In Mosul, for example, this was reported in a complete and consistent way. Most Mosul clerics, almost 90 percent, were labeled as independent. The vast majority of Basra clerics were also labeled as political independents. Independent (i.e., having non-Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist designation) should not be interpreted as harmful to regime interests, however. Assessments of clerics from Wasit are illuminating in this regard. While there were a large number of “independent” clerics in Wasit, extra details in their evaluations suggest that they were secret party collaborators.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Reporting about clerics from Baghdad also exhibited considerable variation.

Hussein’s militia sought to acquire better quality intelligence regarding religious institutions. Intelligence officers were to be selected according to a variety of criteria, including mental flexibility, faithfulness, and the ability to act quickly in critical situations. It was also suggested that such individuals should not have tribal problems or personal enemies.

It is perhaps unsurprising that the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime, with its strong secular leanings, clashed with religious activists in Iraq. Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party elite recognized the mobilizational power of religion and continually sought to monitor and neutralize religious influence. Hussein worked defensively to manage the political threat posed by religious mobilization with the goal of doing so “before it turned completely against his Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime.”<span class="s19">191 </span>In the face of a strong and repressive state, the Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i clergy typically acquiesced to the system, preferring to focus on spiritual life.<span class="s19">192 </span>Reluctant to engage in direct forms of political contestation, most clerics created their “own domain of schools, students, followers, and charities.”<span class="s19">193</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Quietism was not the choice of all clerics, however, and where political transgressions by religious activists did occur, the regime sought to pun- ish those activists. Da<span class="s18">c</span>wa Party members were ruthlessly persecuted during the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime. And between 1970 and 1985, at least forty-one Mus- lim clerics—many of whom were associated with the Da<span class="s18">c</span>wa Party—were executed.<span class="s19">194 </span>Gathering accurate intelligence about the activities of religious activists, however, held special challenges for the regime. Religious groups tended to be insular, made up of individuals with family ties and marriage connections. Each major cleric had his students, followers, and mechanisms for the distribution of club goods. Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i religious seminaries were difficult for Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists to penetrate compared to other civil society groups as they sometimes operated in Farsi, rather than Arabic. Within those networks, it was difficult for the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime to identify political transgressors even if they knew the general locus of the transgression. Ultimately, the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party regime lacked the manpower and resources to manage the religious domain effectively and, as a result, chose to repress problematic religious activists.<span class="s19">195</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In the wake of the 1991 Uprisings, Muhammad Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr emerged as a major religious figure.

In the letter, the officials extolled the citizens of Basra and Dhi Qar for their willingness to give up their possessions, their lives, and even the lives of their children to serve the regime. To document this commitment, the officials provided various forms of evidence including that high percentages of residents had volunteered for regime militias; that tribal leaders were assisting in the defense of borders with Iran and Kuwait and had promised to avoid fighting with each other so that they might better protect the country from foreign attack; that women, teenagers, the disabled, and the elderly were participating in fedayeen training camps; and that local leaders would transport participants to fedayeen training at their own personal expense.<span class="s19">1 </span>The officials also reported that a large number of these militia volunteers had signed blood oaths and had dedicated their worldly possessions to the regime.<span class="s19">2</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A letter of this sort raises a number of important questions. Why did officials from Basra and Dhi Qar seek to signal the commitment of their constituents in this way? And what value did the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime see in militia volunteers who were poorly positioned to actually engage in militia activities? Finally, why would individuals seek to volunteer for this type of military service?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1.

Coups launched from the bottom rungs of the military hierarchy are akin to mutinies and tend to be violent, confused, and unlikely to succeed (Singh 2014, 10).</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">6.

Despite the relatively fragmented nature of the security apparatus, Hussein himself served as a key coordinating and centralizing authority. In addition, security agencies served to check one another to ensure that no organization reported false information. For example, multiple security organizations produced biannual reports on the activities of hostile political movements within Iraq.<span class="s19">14</span></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">This chapter explores the relationship between the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime and the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Iraqi military, broadly defined. A first empirical focus relates to the question of draft dodging. I address what this phenomenon meant for regime stability, but also what draft evasion suggested about Iraqi society and societal attempts at political defiance. A next empirical section takes up the question of how and why the regime created a series of ancillary military units, in particular, state- and party-sponsored militias. I discuss the units created, which segments of Iraqi society were mobilized for participation in those units, and how such units assisted in efforts at safeguarding the regime. Finally, I consider regime vulnerability to coup attempts, most of which were initiated by elements from within the Iraqi military. While the regime became increasingly vulnerable to internal military threats during the international sanctions period, none of these coups was successful. I attribute the failure to overthrow Hussein during this period, at least in part, to the high degree of security service penetration of the predominantly Sunni military officer corps.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">military-ba<span class="s49">c</span>th party relations</p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The Iraqi military became increasingly subordinated to the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party during Hussein’s period of political power.

The net result of this was a dilution of Tikriti political power.<span class="s19">37 </span>Officers from the so-called Sunni triangle, including towns like Ana, Bayji, Dur, Sharqat, Samarra, and Ramadi, became increasingly important, with a high degree of representation from tribal networks including the Dulaimi, Juburi, <span class="s18">c</span>Azzawi, and <span class="s18">c</span>Ubaydi.<span class="s19">38</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Immediately after the cessation of fighting in the Iran-Iraq War, it became clear that maintenance of such a large standing army was beyond the eco- nomic capability of the regime.

Levi, for example, considers issues of political consent in the context of military service requirements as imposed by democratic regimes in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.<span class="s19">58 </span>I consider the conditions under which individuals avoid service obligations in an autocracy where issues of shared social obligation and quasi-voluntary action take on a different meaning. Iraqi citizens were long cynical about military conscription.<span class="s19">59 </span>Military conscription, however, was an important part of the nation-building project where service in the military was a strategy “to cement the public’s loyalty to a patriotic and professional army that would incorporate Iraqis of all sects and ethnicities, as well as urban, rural and tribal elements into a cohesive, national institution.”<span class="s19">60 </span>The Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime was highly concerned with the issue of deserters and, indeed, spent considerable resources trying to locate individuals who failed to complete their compulsory military service. Why was the issue of draft evasion so important to the regime?

Draft evaders were often forced into marginal or illegal economic activities, like black marketeering, that worked against state attempts to fix prices and control markets. The party worked to educate the public that desertion was a treasonous act that created an “atmosphere of crime and lawlessness and undermined public safety.”<span class="s19">61 </span>War deserters sometimes formed their own gangs in cities like Baghdad, contributing to urban crime.<span class="s19">62 </span>High levels of military desertion also challenged the regime narrative of a “heroic national struggle” against external enemies, like Iran.<span class="s19">63</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Draft dodging represented an unusual political space since it created a fundamental information problem for the regime.

Because individuals avoid the draft for a variety of reasons, including fear of injury or death during the course of military service, evasion of military service was not an exclusive marker of political opposition. Yet while there existed compelling, apolitical incentives to avoid compulsory military service, draft evasion could be viewed as a form of political defiance.</a><span class="s19">64 </span>Khoury writes that because outright resistance to the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party was difficult to organize, such resistance “manifested itself most clearly with significant resistance to the war and took the form of desertion, dereliction of duty, or surrender to the enemy.”<span class="s19">65</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">To what extent did draft evasion rely on the complicity of others? Draft evasion was an act often only possible with the existence of social cohesion where extended family networks might provide financial or other forms of support for the draft dodger while in hiding.

While rewards associated with exemplary service or martyrdom in war were offered to the martyr’s family, punishment for desertion was also applied to the extended family. According to Khoury, punishment for desertion involved sanctions levied against extended family and second-degree kin (173). The overall effect of this form of policing and repression was that an individual’s behavior was tied to the rights of his kin with the effect of “augmenting the regulatory power of kin and entrenching clan loyalties” (174). Collective punishment of the families of deserters intensified in 1994 when it was ordered that if someone in the family was a deserter, the family would have to give up its ration card (154).</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark276">engaged in forms of draft evasion by being slow to report for their military service.</a><span class="s19">69 </span>Able-bodied men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five were conscripted into the armed forces or militias—a military necessity given the population advantage Iran enjoyed over Iraq.<span class="s19">70 </span>Desertion was punishable by death, though a variety of documents suggest that this directive was not strictly enforced.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: right;">Most deserters and draft dodgers in the early 1980s were Kurds who could find refuge in mountain areas controlled by Kurdish guerillas.<span class="s19">71 </span>Many Kurdish Iraqis were exempted from military service if they volunteered for pro-regime militias, like the <i>jash</i>, which helped to control the Kurdish North.<span class="s19">72 </span>But the regime continued to issue arrest orders for deserters and stragglers in northern districts as well as directives to take control of financial resources belonging to these individuals should they fail to complete some form of military service.<span class="s19">73 </span>By the mid- to late 1980s, the problem of desertions was common in the south as well. This is probably not surprising given the large numbers of Iraqi soldiers from southern governorates who were being killed or taken prisoner during the course of combat.

Bounded by Amara in the North, Nasiriyya in the West, and Basra in the East, the Iraqi marshes were among the largest wetland ecosystems in Western Asia. Some estimates suggest that by October 1986, 30,000 deserters were hiding in the southern marshes.<span class="s19">78 </span>The existence of large numbers of deserters in the marshes constituted a security problem for the regime.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A 1987 report provided recommendations from a committee regarding operational implementation of a plan for the marsh areas.<span class="s19">79 </span>The report acknowledged that the marshes had become a haven for deserters, outlaws, and members of hostile parties who sought to launch sabotage operations. Recommendations included renewed security operations in the marshes. It was also suggested that deserters hiding in the marshes might be turned into informants in exchange for amnesty for deserting military service. Villages were collectively punished through a variety of channels including economic seige, the banning of the sale of fish, and refusing to give marsh dwellers their food rations.<span class="s19">80 </span>According to Fuller and Francke, a classified report entitled “Plan of Action for the Marshes” discussed imposition of economic sanctions and other forms of collective punishment against marsh communities.<span class="s19">81</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Reports from the spring and summer of 1987 provide information on draft dodging for the Euphrates region, which encompasses governorates including the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala as well as Babil, Qadisiyya, and Muthanna.<span class="s19">82 </span>For the period between May 27 and June 26, 1987, the total number of deserters arrested in the Euphrates region was 374, and another 2,216 deserters surrendered themselves to authorities.

Areas with the largest number of deserters are the Saddam City neighborhood of Baghdad and the southern governorates of Basra and Dhi Qar. The number of deserters from Sunni areas like Salah al-Din and Anbar is small. These data are consistent with my theoretical expectation that after 1991, forms of “underground” transgression that relied on the cooperation of trusted others would be highest for Shi</a><span class="s18">c</span><a href="#bookmark279" class="s13">i communities within Iraq. </a>Table 10.1 also provides information about the degree to which local authorities complied with the demand to amputate the ears of deserters. There exists considerable variation on this measure. Notably, northern areas saw the largest percentage of ears amputated as a percentage of draft dodgers and deserters.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">participation in militia organizations</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The regime, led by the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party, took a number of steps to depoliticize the Iraqi military while simultaneously creating a series of ancillary mili- tary units—state- and party-sponsored militias—that could serve as counter- armies should there ever be a move by the military against the regime. Indeed, the regime was especially concerned about controlling risks associated with attempts at military overthrow.<span class="s19">93 </span>These new organizations included the Special Republican Guard—formed after the 1991 Uprisings to provide a potential balance to existing Republic Guard forces—and various militia units, like Saddam’s Fedayeen. Graham-Brown has suggested that Saddam’s Fedayeen was formed in 1995 out of fear of regional and tribal interests from Sunnis living in Anbar and Mosul.<span class="s19">94</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Fedayeen units were meant to represent the organization of individuals willing to make the highest level of sacrifice for the regime. The idea of organizing units of individuals who were willing to sacrifice themselves for the president, party, and Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist revolution likely drew inspiration from militant Palestinian nationalists who were willing to risk their lives for the Palestinian cause. A speech given by Hussein at al-Bakr University in 1978 emphasizes the importance of self-sacrifice.

In the months and years following the demonstrations, hundreds of Iraqis sent personal letters volunteering themselves, and sometimes their relatives, for “suicide” or “sacrifice” oper- ations (<span class="s18">c</span><i>amaliyyat fida’iyya</i>). One boxfile within the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party Regional Command files is a collection of these letters. Most of the volunteers promised to defend the nation and the revolution at any cost. In one letter, the head of the Kartan tribe offered more than two dozen tribesmen from across the country for service to Hussein and the regime.<span class="s19">96 </span>Volunteers from the western province of Anbar are also found in the file.<span class="s19">97</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Most volunteers, however, were individuals living in the heavily Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i provinces of southern Iraq. A September 1991 letter from two female volunteers from Wasit promised to defend Iraq and the revolution to the death, with a signature of bloody thumbprints as a token of their commit- ment.<span class="s19">98 </span>Volunteers from Wasit and multiple individuals from Qadisiyya appear as volunteers in the files.<span class="s19">99 </span>Dozens of individuals from Basra and other southern areas also offered themselves for such operations.<span class="s19">100 </span>Why would individuals from a community that was subjected to serious political and social repression volunteer to sacrifice themselves for Hussein, the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party, and Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist revolution? Even more so than members of the Sunni community, Iraqi Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a needed to find costly ways to signal their commitment to the regime if they were to be viewed as compliant. One way that an individual might signal this commitment was to volunteer for a “suicide” militia of this sort.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Volunteerism, particularly the decision to volunteer for a dangerous or costly activity like “self-sacrifice,” is puzzling.

The militias were a major subject of rumors circulating in Iraq during the late 1990s and early 2000s, reflecting the growing importance of such institutions in the final years of the Ba<span class="s21">c</span>thist regime. In November 1997, it was rumored that night school students would be taken into Saddam’s Fedayeen; a related rumor suggested that students who registered for vocational</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">school would be withdrawn and, instead, enrolled in Saddam’s Fedayeen (BRCC Doc. No. 01- 3713-0000-0618, November 10, 1997; BRCC Doc. No. 01-3713-0000-0559, November 22,</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">1997). In February 2000, rumors circulated that volunteers for Saddam’s Fedayeen would be sent to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and northern areas (BRCC Doc. No. 01-2912-0004-0500, February 21, 2000). Another rumor suggested that any individual killed during their service as part of Saddam’s Fedayeen would receive 25,000 US dollars in compensation for their families from Saudi Arabia (BRCC Doc. No. 01-2912-0004-0473 September 6, 2000).</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">103.

Al-Marashi and Salama have suggested that recruits to these units were often very loyal to the regime elite and enjoyed benefits like higher salaries compared to other military units.<span class="s19">106 </span>For example, in 1998, fedayeen fighters were reported to receive a salary of 30,000 Iraqi dinars per month, a large salary for that time, especially during the embargo.<span class="s19">107 </span>Saddam’s Fedayeen came to develop a reputation for being a kind of criminal gang responsible for acts of extreme violence.<span class="s19">108</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Yet the costs for poor performance in the group were potentially severe. One memorandum issued by the head of Saddam’s Fedayeen to the com- manders of various lower level units provided guidance on when unit leaders should be executed for poor performance.<span class="s19">109 </span>For example, the memorandum states that if two or more sections of a platoon commander are defeated, he would be executed; similarly, if a regiment commander had two of his companies defeated, he would be executed, and so on. There also existed a standing execution order for fedayeen fighters who hesitated in carrying out an order; cooperated with the enemy; damaged equipment; or hid information from the party, country, or leader.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">In addition to Saddam’s Fedayeen, the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party recruited individuals for</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">its own fedayeen unit. A series of documents from the early 2000s provide information about the names of individuals who volunteered for the party fedayeen, among other paramilitary groups. These lists often include hundreds of names and many of the individuals have names that indicate a tribal affiliation. For example, a document listing volunteers for the party fedayeen provides the names of 338 individuals. About half of these individuals had names that indicated a tribal affiliation with over eighty unique tribes repre- sented, suggesting the breadth of the volunteer base for militias of this type.</p><ol id="l161"><li><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">Al-Marashi and Salama 2008, 187.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Sassoon 2012, 150.

Financial and careerist incentives seemed to be a major driver of recruitment.

Volunteerism is statistically significantly higher in Sunni areas for all four spec- ifications (Models 10.1 through 10.4), controlling for other factors. Wealth and population density are not significant predictors in any specification. I use Model 10.4 to calculate predicted probabilities associated with the results; holding wealth and population density at their means, for Sunnis from Tikrit, the predicted probability is 5 percent. For Sunnis living 200 miles from Tikrit, however, it is only 2 percent. For Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a living 200 miles from Tikrit it is less than 1 percent, but for Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a living 400 miles from Tikrit it is 2 percent. This suggests that by 2001–2002, Sunni students from in and around Tikrit were most likely to join Saddam’s Fedayeen, controlling for other factors, but that Sunnis living some distance from Tikrit were statistically less likely to do so. Within the Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i community, areas most peripheral, measured in distance from Tikrit, had higher volunteer rates than Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i areas closer to

About 2.3 percent of Baghdad students volunteered in 2001–2002 to be in Saddam’s Fedayeen. </a>Table 10.6 reports the results of a series of logistic regressions where the individual student is the unit of analysis and the outcome variable is whether or not the student volunteered for Saddam’s Fedayeen. Model 10.5 reports the results with the inclusion of variables meant to capture ethnicity and educational track. In this model, Kurdish students are less likely to volunteer than Arab students, and students living in Sunni districts are more likely to volunteer than those in non-Sunni districts. Science-track students are also statistically less likely to volunteer than others. Model 10.6 takes into account whether the student or his family enjoyed “friend of the president” status. I find that “friend of the president” status is highly correlated with propensity to volunteer for Saddam’s Fedayeen. Model 10.7 takes into account agglomer- ation effects. I find that the larger the percentage of students in the school who are volunteering, the more likely an individual student is to volunteer. In this model specification, the effect of Kurdish ethnicity is no longer statistically significant. Conditional on agglomeration effects, literature-track students are more likely than other types of students to volunteer and Sunni districts see a reduced probability of volunteering.</p><p

Higher education institutions supported by the military and state secu- rity took on a number of forms, including the College of Military Engineering, the Police Academy, and the Police Preparatory School, in addition to the First Military College, Naval Academy, and Air Force Academy, including pilot training. It was also possible for students to have their medical studies paid for by the Ministry of Defense, and special positions were reserved for both men and women to receive these opportunities. Finally, there were specialized training opportunities including for officers of the interior security forces and courses for law enforcement officials and judges. While some of these programs had a very high acceptance rate, others were more selective, like acceptance into the College of Military Engineering and applications for Ministry of Defense–sponsored medical training.<span class="s19">130</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">With the goal of creating a loyal and ideologically oriented military, it became increasingly important to make sure that the military academy was</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">130.

Another set of memoranda discuss students seeking admission into the First Military College in 1993. In one case, a Ba</a><span class="s18">c</span>thist who had otherwise encouraging information was discovered to have had a maternal cousin who had been executed during the Iran-Iraq War for feebleness, or cowardice, in combat. Another cousin was serving a prison term for thievery and his aunt’s husband was under suspicion for pro-Iranian political inclinations.

He was not admitted but added to a “reserve” pool of individuals who might be considered at a later time. A fourth candidate with the tribal name Juburi had a favorable file except that his father’s cousin had been sentenced to twenty years in prison for conspiracy against the regime in 1990 (though he was later pardoned). A handwritten note on the file suggests that he should be rejected. A final candidate discussed had an acceptable file except that his father’s cousin was formerly a Communist, though no longer at odds with the regime.

Under the sanc- tions regime, Sunnis peripheral to Tikrit saw significant declines in quality of life and, despite the instrumental role they had played in putting down the uprisings, did not enjoy the same levels of access, employment, and privilege as Sunnis from in and around Tikrit. According to one well-placed military source, by the end of the 1990s over 80 percent of officers came from Salah al-Din governorate, particularly Tikrit, while only 10 percent were from Mosul and less than 10 percent from Anbar governorate.<span class="s19">152</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Publicly Reported Assassination and Coup Attempts</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Coup attempts were a common feature of Iraqi political life during Hussein’s presidency. Despite the many coup attempts documented in both the media and scholarly sources, none were successful in unseating Hussein. A key reason for their failure relates to the fact that the institution best positioned to overthrow the regime—the Sunni-controlled military—was also highly legible to the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party regime.

In that incident, Hussein’s motorcade was attacked as it passed through the small town of Dujayl, north of Baghdad. Although Dujayl is located in the predominantly Sunni governorate of Salah al-Din, the inhabitants of the town were mostly Shi<span class="s21">c</span>a. Following a speech by Hussein in the town, his</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">motorcade was attacked by gunmen hiding in date orchards adjacent to the road. Eventually more than 100 townspeople were executed for the attempt, which was thought to have been organized by Da<span class="s21">c</span>wa Party activists.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark295">Many of the documented coup attempts against Hussein took place follow- ing the end of the Iran-Iraq War. In the aftermath of the conflict, Hussein’s status was threatened by the growing stature of generals who emerged from the conflict as national war heroes. As Hussein sought to sideline these individuals, some moved against him. Scores of officers were arrested and accused of belonging to a secret organization attempting to bring down the government; other officers were forced into retirement.</a><span class="s19">155 </span>Assassination plots against Hussein were uncovered in 1988 and early 1989 and military purges followed.<span class="s19">156 </span>According to Al-Marashi and Salama:</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The removal of the generals convinced some officers to plan a coup before further purges would affect them. A plot within the military to assassinate Hussein unfolded in late 1988 and later resulted in the execution of dozens of complicit Republican Guard officers. In November 1988 a plan was discovered to shoot down Saddam Hussein’s plane on his way to Egypt. A third coup attempt within the armed forces was discovered in September 1989.<span class="s19">157</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">One of the likely victims of these purges was the Iraqi Minister of Defense Adnan Khayrallah—cousin and brother-in-law of Hussein—who was killed in a suspicious helicopter crash.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In January 1990, the Special Security Organization successfully pre-empted a coup by military officers of the Juburi tribe who sought to assassinate Hussein.<span class="s19">158 </span>The Juburi had been important contributors of troops during the Iran-Iraq War and, in exchange, public money and jobs were channeled to the group; yet Hussein was suspicious that Juburi were becoming too powerful within the regime so he fired two Juburi ministers, effectively cutting the benefits to the community.<span class="s19">159 </span>The attempted coup was seen as a reaction to Hussein’s efforts to weaken Juburi influence.

Dulaimi tribesmen—who had been critical in putting down the 1991 Uprisings—revolted against the regime in 1995 after the execution of General Muhammad al-Dulaimi and a number of other Dulaimi officers. Muhammad al-Dulaimi was suspected of plotting a coup against Hussein. A number of other tribes, including the Jumailat, Anis, Rawis, and Kubaysis—were reported to sympathize with the Dulaimis. Press reports from that period suggest that the rebellion was also linked to a shrinking of Hussein’s power base.<span class="s19">171 </span>It was reported that as many as 1,000 soldiers and officers from a Republican Guard unit were involved in the protests.<span class="s19">172  </span>A battalion led by General Turki al-Dulaimi is reported to have attacked a radio transmitter and helicopter base at Abu Ghraib, on the outskirts of Baghdad.<span class="s19">173 </span>In 1996, officers associated with the al-Duri tribe—also from Anbar province—were accused of attempting a coup. According to Al-Marashi and Salama, “since trusted tribes like the Dur and Dulaim were involved in these coups,” Hussein promoted officers from other tribes as a way to balance his</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">vulnerability.<span class="s19">174</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">While knowledge or even strong suspicion of disloyalty meant the end of an individual’s life, it did not mean that entire tribes were dislocated from the patronage structure, particularly for Sunni Arab tribes that tended to be the most legible to the regime. The existence of a “black sheep” within the broader tribal group did not spell the end of political life for all fellow tribesmen.<span class="s19">175 </span>Even after the Dulaimis participated in a tribal revolt, the tribe was able, to a considerable degree, to rehabilitate themselves in the eyes of Hussein.<span class="s19">176</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">170.

In January 1993, a rumor suggested that a coup led by a military officer would take place on the 19th of the month.<span class="s19">180 </span>In early February 1993, another rumor reported that participants in the attempted coup had been military officers from the Abedi and Juburi tribes.<span class="s19">181 </span>Juburi participation in this attempt was later confirmed by other sources and may have been the follow-up to an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1990.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In April 1993, a number of rumors circulated regarding failed coup attempts. It was rumored that Samir al-Shaykhli—a former mayor of Baghdad</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Provoking a military coup undertaken by Iraqi security officials was long considered the preferred outcome by US intelligence officials who sought to dislodge Hussein. Press reports suggest that in the summer of 1996, several dozen Iraqis working with US intelligence inside Iraq were arrested and executed in the wake of a failed coup attempt. See Tim Weiner, “For 3rd Time in 21 Years, Saddam Hussein’s Foes Pay Price for a Foiled US Plot,” <i>New York Times</i>, September 9, 1996 for more on the US role in Iraqi coup-making. By 2002, however, CIA officials viewed a successful coup as unlikely.

The individuals targeted in these rumored assassination attempts ranged from government ministers to anti-regime activists to Saddam Hussein himself.

Many of these rumors also included information about the likely perpetrators of the attack.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">More than a dozen rumors suggested assassination attempts against Saddam Hussein.

Military defections were also politically problematic for the regime, as exemplified by the defections of Hussein and Saddam Kamel, sons-in-law to Saddam Hussein. A handful of reported rumors focus on the subject of high-level defections. While less threatening than a coup or assassination attempt against Hussein or his sons, the defection of senior military officials could politically damage the regime. All four rumors of this type appeared over a five- month period in 2000; each rumor was also reported by the Ba<span class="s21">c</span>th Party branch leadership in southern Iraq. One rumor suggested a plan by Iyad Fatih Khalifa al-Rawi to escape to Syria after an attempted plot against the regime (BRCC Doc. No. 133-5-7-0063, March 25, 2000). Two rumors point to the escape from Iraq of Hamid Sha<span class="s21">c</span>ban, a major figure in the Iraqi Air Force, with one rumor suggesting ten officers fled with him (BRCC Doc.

Saddam Hussein long recognized the potential threat posed by the military. Dominated by a party-oriented civilian leadership, the regime was highly vulnerable to overthrow by generals who controlled troops and weapons. As a result, civil-military cooperation was seen as dangerous. The Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists believed that the only way to reduce vulnerability to the military was by subordinating it completely.<span class="s19">217 </span>According to Sassoon, the regime was “intent on infiltrating the army and monitoring its movements . . . a plethora of intelligence and security services had the sole function of being alert to any sign of mutiny or dissension.”<span class="s19">218</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In addition to the challenge of coup plots by members of the military elite, Hussein was simultaneously concerned with popular revolt by ordinary Iraqi soldiers and a near epidemic of military desertion that threatened the capa- bilities and legitimacy of his regime. Failure to effectively manage conscripted soldiers had the potential to damage military effectiveness, claims of regime legitimacy, and even social stability. As a result, the regime was preoccupied with management of both elite and rank-and-file concerns associated with the military.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Because Iraq was almost continually at war between 1980 and 1991, the country was in a “hypermilitarized” state where war preparation and war making were integrated into multiple aspects of governance.<span class="s19">219 </span>While enor- mous financial resources were directed into the expansion of Iraqi military capacity, “the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime skillfully worked to neutralize that huge insti- tution politically.”<span class="s19">220 </span>This took place in a number of ways, particularly the “Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thification” of the army and use of the party bureaucracy to screen military recruits.<span class="s19">221</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Downsizing of the military began in earnest starting in 1991 and, combined with the economic impact of the trade embargo, created a uniquely difficult situation for the regime.

A key observable implication of those changes were the regime-threatening coup and assassination attempts that took place during the 1990s. To try to counter those threats, the regime created multiple paramilitary organizations to serve as effective counterweights to the regular army. By creating these multiple internal security groups, the collective identity of the military was damaged, but it became increasingly difficult for any single military or militia unit to move against the regime.</a><span class="s19">222 </span>The multiple, failed coup attempts that took place in Iraq during the 1990s simultaneously reflected the deep dissatisfaction of many non-Tikriti Sunnis with Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist rule but also the complete security sector penetration of those networks that sought to unseat Hussein.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">222.

And some have speculated that in the absence of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists would have continued in power for years to come.<span class="s19">1</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">A first-order question might be “why Iraq?” In other words, why did Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist Iraq have such oppressive, and ultimately dysfunctional, governance when compared to other Middle Eastern states? Although neighboring states were not particularly free, few developed the apparatus for coercion and the will to repress found in Iraq under Hussein. My argument suggests that challenging structural constraints combined with external shocks to undermine state-building. In particular, the regime’s inability to monitor and accurately punish dissent in Iraq’s diverse population contributed to the use and impact of state violence. I develop an account for how variation in societal legibility can lead states to engage in repressive behaviors that ultimately undermine their state-building efforts.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The external challenges facing the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime, while in no way unique, may have been more intense than those confronting otherwise similar autocratic regimes. A large endowment of oil resources meant that by the late 1970s, Iraq was among the most wealthy, modern, and sophisticated countries in the Middle East. But if oil wealth facilitated state- and nation- building in the 1970s, it also contributed to the curse of raised societal expectations, a heightening of regime hubris vis-à-vis other regional actors,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l170"><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Dimitrov and Sassoon 2014. Given the staggering costs of the war—estimated by some at over $1 trillion—few Americans would say that the US intervention was worth what was paid in lives and money, not to mention the negative, downstream impact of regional instability in the wake of the American withdrawal from Iraq. When one speaks to Iraqis, however, many see the war as an act of liberation, freeing millions from political oppression.</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark307">and a profound vulnerability to shocks in the world market for oil. The unanticipated resilience of Iran in the face of the Iran-Iraq War, combined with the 1986 collapse in the world price of oil, left the Ba</a><span class="s18">c</span>thist regime politically exposed and susceptible to popular unrest. Political decisions were made under conditions of wartime stress. In this context, Hussein found himself increasingly confronting a set of regime-threatening circumstances that seemed outside of his control.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In addition to the vulnerability to external shocks, the regime’s limited ability to effectively monitor Iraq’s diverse populations represented a second fundamental challenge. Effective monitoring of a population most directly relates to issues of state capacity. Herbst writes about how physical geography and low population density make it difficult for African states to exert control over their territories.<span class="s19">2 </span>To that, I would suggest that cultural distance can decrease legibility of a state’s citizenry. In Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist Iraq, there was considerable unevenness in the state’s ability to penetrate society, at least in part because of language differences and geographic inaccessibility. This is not to say that the state-building enterprise is doomed to fail in plural societies but, rather, that diverse societies face particular challenges that are most effectively overcome with extensive bureaucratic investment and public goods provision. Plural societies also require a commitment to an equitable distribution of state burdens and restraint on the part of the regime when faced with the impulse to punish under conditions of limited information.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Even if we are unable to answer definitively the question of why Iraq emerged as among the most repressive autocratic countries of the twentieth century, examining individual and community responses to growing autocracy in Iraq provides a window into how forms of resistance and compliance emerge under such regimes.<span class="s19">3 </span>Scholars who seek to characterize compliance</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: justify;">Herbst 2000.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Despite a rich and growing theoretical and empirical literature on a range of citizen behaviors under conditions of social, political, and economic repression, I was not able to identify a single theoretical framework for understanding behavioral outcomes across the full spectrum of potential behaviors, from collaboration to rebellion. Petersen (2001) comes closest by both identifying the full spectrum of behaviors and then explaining, with great care, the conditions under which individuals and communities might move from one position on the spectrum to the next. My account differs from Petersen (2001) in a number of ways, including more focused attention on behaviors beyond resistance and rebellion, and by adopting a view that individuals and communities might move discontinuously (i.e., not sequentially) across behaviors under conditions of political repression.</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark308">with and resistance to onerous political and economic demands suggest that individual behavior reflects a complex set of material and cognitive consider- ations. On a most basic level, the need for survival often serves as a motivator for compliant behavior in high-stakes political environments. Citizens of dictatorships are required to make constant, tacit choices regarding whether to do what is expected of them or deviate from regime expectations of behavior. Authoritarian regimes cannot survive without groups of individuals who are active and willing cooperators with the dictator. Often such cooperation affords individuals, and sometimes their families, forms of physical secu- rity that cannot be achieved in other ways. Yet the degree of support and collaboration observed often exceeds expectations given the mental stress and discomfort we might expect when in close cooperation with a political oppressor.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Despite the considerable personal vulnerability to which one is exposed as a result of non-compliant behavior, individuals living in dictatorships do sometimes engage in highly dangerous acts of protest and resistance that put themselves, and often those with whom they are associated, at considerable risk. When citizens choose to break with regime expectations of appropriate behavior, regimes respond with punishments that are contingent upon a number of factors, including the type of behavior, the political position of the transgressor, and the regime’s ability to accurately identify the transgres- sor. Totalitarian regimes are characterized—to a greater degree than their authoritarian counterparts—by increasing intensity of punishment for polit- ical transgressions. That said, Iraq under Saddam Hussein was situational in its totalitarianism.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Influential studies have sought to endogenize citizen behavior—like participation in a revolutionary social movement—as a function of state action.

States are key actors in this narrative. This is not because states and their leaders, like Saddam Hussein, invent the ethno-national, religious, or tribal cleavages that exist within their societies, but rather because dictators make ugly and destructive policy choices, particularly when faced with financial limitations and governance constraints, and these choices influence the political beliefs and behaviors of their citizens.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In my narrative of Iraqi political development, the 1970s stand out as a period of intense state-building in terms of the capacity and reach of the formal structures of power, but also a period of nation-building in terms of the cultivation of Iraqi nationalist sentiment that emerged in response to the distributive ability of the state. The Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime’s success in the 1970s was not a reflection of Hussein’s genius but, rather, a function of the regime’s willingness to spend the country’s oil windfall on public goods and state employment in ways that helped large segments of the population. During that period, Iraqis from across a variety of sectors—state bureaucrats, teachers, businessmen, and artisans—experienced upward mobility and with it strengthened their allegiance to the Iraqi state and the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party.<span class="s19">7 </span>Inter- marriage across ethno-sectarian groups was common and business partner- ships often included Iraqis of different religious and ethnic backgrounds.<span class="s19">8</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6.

When the regime sought to punish individuals for their transgressions, the often collective nature of punishment impacted identity in ways that undercut the state-building efforts of the 1970s. For example, collective punishment of Kurdish populations as a result of cross- border collaboration between Iran and peshmerga units during the Iran-Iraq War contributed to Kurdish feelings of nationalism. Indiscriminate punish- ment of Iraqi Kurds served as a shared experience for northern populations and created a common belief about the linked nature of their future survival.

It is true that Kurdish social and political movements—like the KDP and the PUK—have historical roots and traditional bases of support, but those legacies do not explain the rapid strengthening of Kurdish national- ist sentiment during the 1980s. Kurdish political behavior reflected choices made in reaction to state action. Previously, cooperation between Kurdish groups had been infrequent and opportunistic, clearly not a result of undying cultural affinity within the community of Iraqi Kurds.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">At the opposite extreme, where high levels of regime penetration into a community were possible, the regime could impose punishments for trans- gressing regime norms in more surgical, precise ways targeted at individuals, not collective groups. The social networks that emerged in such a context were weak, discouraging societal policing of in-group transgressors while simultane- ously increasing the probability of within-group denunciations.<span class="s19">13 </span>In addition, the ease with which information could be gathered on opposition to the regime meant that sharing feelings of anti-regime sentiment with anyone— even trusted confidants—was tantamount to a public act. As a result, forms of public defiance were more common among Iraqi Sunnis than non-Sunnis. The reliance on Iraqis from Tikrit and neighboring areas also represented a decrease in political importance for those from Upper Euphrates towns, like Ana and Ramadi, in Anbar governorate.<span class="s19">14 </span>For example, Dodge, describing the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist period, writes that “the Sunnis who are not Tikritis feel discriminated against.”<span class="s19">15</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">This sense of discrimination within the Sunni community became exacer- bated over the course of the sanctions period, manifesting itself in public forms of political discontent by non-Tikriti Sunnis, including a reluctance to iden- tify with the party and increasing prevalence of coup attempts. Interpersonal rivalries between high-level elites—like those that existed between Hussein’s sons and his sons-in-law—were well-known and a “lack of trust” prevailed among the military leadership in Iraq.<span class="s19">16 </span>Among non-elites a similar pattern is apparent.

As they bore the disproportionate burden of war “tax” for Iraqi society, however, many Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a increasingly came to resent the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime. But despite the hardship of war and economic austerity imposed on Shi<span class="s18">c</span>a, these communities did not seek to “separate from the state” and instead sought “political power and representation in the government in proportion to their weight among the population.”<span class="s19">18</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">When transgressive political acts took place in predominantly Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i areas like Saddam City in Baghdad, the Shrine Cities of Najaf and Karbala, and rural and urban areas of southern Iraq, the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist regime struggled to ascertain the transgressors with precision. As a result, the Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thists meted out punishment based on available intelligence. Since the regime’s penetration of Shi<span class="s18">c</span>i communities was imperfect, punishment for political transgression was blunt, often at the level of the communal group. These communal groups might include clans or tribes, but also collectives based on the followers of a particular religious leader. As a result, regime dragnets led to the arrest of individuals with only a loosely shared identity affiliation with the bad actor. Yet punishment of individuals based on this shared group identity had the effect of actually encouraging further identification at the group level. From an empirical perspective, increasing interpersonal trust at the group level was associated with rumormongering and draft evasion—political activities only possible within socially cohesive communities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">relationship to existing work on ba<span class="s49">c</span>thist iraq</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">While the narrative I have put forward is out-of-step with journalistic accounts of Iraqi politics, how do my findings speak to the extensive existing literature on Saddam Hussein and Ba<span class="s18">c</span>thist Iraq?

For example, within the category of Iraqi Sunnis, individuals and families from central Iraq were disproportionate beneficiaries of regime largesse relative to those from western Iraq; and within central Iraq, certain tribes from in and around Hussein’s region of origin—for example, members of the Juburi tribe—were favored over others.

Others have emphasized social cleavages based on regional identities (Visser 2008).

In particular, the Coalition Provi- sional Authority and the Iraqi leadership council agreed to the formation of the 25-member Iraqi Governing Council (IGC), which was inaugurated in July 2003. Ethno-sectarian apportionment was a defining, structural feature of the council. Such a selection strategy was based on a stylized conventional wisdom about the “tripartite” nature of Iraqi society, but the net effect was to increase the salience of ethnic divides in Iraq. In the end, the desire to make the council’s composition mirror Iraq’s ethno-sectarian demographics deepened these societal rifts.<span class="s19">40</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The International Crisis Group was prescient in its analysis in 2003.

Its members were chosen so as to mirror Iraq’s sectarian and ethnic makeup; for the first time in the country’s history, the guiding assumption is that political representation must be apportioned according to such quotas. This decision reflects how the Council’s creators, not the Iraqi people, view Iraqi society and politics, but it will not be without consequence. Ethnic and religious conflict, for the most part absent from Iraq’s modern history, is likely to be exacerbated as its people increasingly organise along these divisive lines.<span class="s19">41</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">It was thought that de-Ba<span class="s21">c</span>thification would create new employment opportunities for non-Sunnis (Harling 2012, 64).</p></li></ol><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">39.

At the same time, the postcolonial states of the Arab world also enjoyed some meaningful advantages and opportu- nities. Memories of anti-colonial struggle often encouraged a sense of social cohesion. Ideological trends, including pan-Arabism and, later, Islamism, were influential in mobilizing popular support and allegiance. And after 1973, natural resource wealth meant that state-building could be undertaken in a robust manner.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">For decades, political elites sought to lay the foundations of a modern Iraqi state built on a shared national identity.<span class="s19">93 </span>The state enacted policies with the goals of political unification, educational uniformity, and homogenization of identity.<span class="s19">94 </span>These goals continued under Ba<span class="s18">c</span>th Party rule.

First, I have sought to create a better understanding of how resources and constraints underlie the use of repression. Second, I have tried to provide a clearer idea of the citizen responses repression prompts.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The ideas and evidence that I have presented in this book are plausibly general even if my application has been focused on the Iraqi case. There are at least two ways that we might think about the generalizability of the arguments and empirical documentation that I have put forward. The first is to consider how my theoretical arguments relate to other literatures on the causes and effects of collective and particularistic political interactions. For example, some of the ideas that I have presented with regard to repression have parallels in the literature on public and private benefits in the distributive politics literature.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The second strategy involves investigating two empirical associations sug- gested by my arguments for a larger sample of cases. One relates to the pre- dicted positive empirical relationship between group legibility and collective punishment. If groups are highly legible to political regimes, they should be subject to fewer instances of collective punishment, all else equal. Another relates to an anticipated positive correlation between a regime’s use of col- lective punishment and a group’s resistance activities. An exploratory analysis of data from the Minorities at Risk (MAR) project provides an opportunity to consider these two empirical relationships using cross-sectional data across a wide variety of groups. While these analyses cannot adequately address inferential concerns about how and why some groups are more or less legible</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Monten 2014.

For example, Cox and Lizzeri and Persico ask why political parties in Britain switch from a strategy of individual bribery of voters to one of programmatic policy benefits.<span class="s19">99 </span>This literature follows a number of similar logical steps to the mechanisms that I have described in my discussion of punishment and repression. First, in both the repression and the rewards cases, it is costly to monitor individuals. Monitoring voters and their behaviors is a non-trivial task that is subsequently associated with the delivery of benefits. Although models represent these monitoring costs in a variety of ways, Cox and Lizzeri and Persico share an implicit assumption that costs are increasing in the number of voters to be rewarded.<span class="s19">100 </span>Since the number of voters changed during the period they study via reforms associated with the expansion of suffrage, Cox and Lizzeri and Persico argue that British parties’ switch from individualized to collective rewards was driven by the increasing number of voters (with monitoring costs held constant). My investigation considers when political regimes might switch from individualized to collective punishment. In my analysis, numbers are held constant but monitoring costs differ across groups. Thus, in both cases, collective strategies are adopted when the monitoring costs associated with an individualized strategy become too great.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Other segments of the distributive politics literature, while not focused</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">on the choice between individualized and collective targeting, share my as- sumption that groups are differentially legible to different political actors. In an influential model of distributive politics, Dixit and Londregan allow transfers between parties and voters to occur via a “leaky bucket”—of the dollars offered by the party to each member of the group, only a fraction</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;">See Cox (1987) and Lizzeri and Persico (2003).</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">As a result of large and, potentially, increasing monitoring costs, members of the elite may wish to reform the political system since a growing electorate increases the electoral value of policies with diffuse, rather than particularistic, benefits.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark326">may get through.</a><span class="s19">101 </span>Importantly, the fraction depends on the identity of the group, a consideration that allows for the possibility that each party has core support groups that it understands well and, as a result, can efficiently deliver benefits to group members. For the case of repression, I argue that monitoring of transgressive behaviors is costly and these costs vary as a result of variation in how legible group populations are to political regimes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Empirical Implications</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Collective punishment has long been used as a way to retaliate against groups when regimes are hard pressed to identify individual rebellious actors. For example, communities might be held collectively responsible when political regimes believe that the collective has been tolerating or harboring subversives. Is retribution always necessary, especially considering the potential negative externalities associated with collective punishment? Regimes prefer that cit- izens never transgress—either because of citizen acquiescence or through successful policing of behavior within the group—but often have to punish since doing nothing generates a positive probability of future rebellion. In- deed, Davenport has called the “law of coercive responsiveness” a core finding in the study of repression. When challenges to the status quo take place, authorities are compelled to employ repressive action to counter or eliminate the behavioral threat.<span class="s19">102</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">There exist a number of historical and contemporary cases that resemble the core empirical expectations of this project. Similar to the Iraqi case, collective punishment is common during periods of war. For example during the First World War, German invasions of Western Europe were marked by numerous acts of collective punishment in response to either real or perceived acts of resistance. During the Second World War, the Nazis were notorious for punishing entire villages—in Poland, Serbia, France, Ukraine and elsewhere— for the assassination of a single Nazi soldier.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">Even in peacetime, however, political regimes engage in forms of collective punishment despite their best efforts to increase the successful monitoring of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">See Dixit and Londregan (1996).</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Davenport (2007) defines the “law of coercive responsiveness” as the idea that governing authorities should respond with repression to behavior that threatens the political system, government personnel, the economy, or the lives, beliefs, and livelihoods of those within their territorial jurisdiction.</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">subject populations.

Only groups that might potentially be at risk are included in the dataset. For multiethnic societies, major identity groups</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark327">as a 0-5 scale that goes from no repression (0) to surveillance (1), harass- ment/containment (2), non-violent coercion (3), violent coercion short of killing (4) and violent coercion including killing (5). This coding includes tactics used by any government agency including the military, police and special security services.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Three variables included in the MAR dataset capture what the coding team describes as “measures of distinctiveness” where the relevant comparison is between the group at risk and the largest (i.e., plurality or majority) ethnic group in the state. These “measures of distinctiveness” might serve as a proxy for the relative legibility of different minority groups. The first measure considers if there is a different language group where groups can either be characterized by linguistic assimilation with the plurality group (0), multiple group languages, at least one of which is different from the plurality group (1), or the group’s use of one language that is different from the plurality group (2). The theoretical expectation would be that increasing language difference should be associated with a higher level of collective punishment of that group. The second variable I consider relates to cultural difference where there are different group customs related to marriage, family, and other societal practices, like dress. For this variable, the coding considers if the group has the same social customs as the plurality group (0) compared to groups with different social customs from the plurality group (1). The third variable which might influence the political regime’s ability to render a societal group “legible” relates to religious difference where a group is coded as either having the same religion as the plurality group (0), being a different sect within the same religion as the plurality group (1), or as a different religion (2).</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">For each of the three variables—language, custom, and religious belief—</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">there is a positive, statistically significant correlation with repression of a group’s civilian population, the measure which I take as a proxy for collective punishment. Going from low to high on each of the measures of distinctive- ness leads groups to move from a predicted probability of no repression of the civilian population to something between harassment and non-violent</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="48" height="1" alt="image" src="10.23943_9781400890323/Image_062.png"/></span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">are all included in the MAR dataset. For example, in Iraq, this would include Kurds, Shi<span class="s21">c</span>a and Sunnis. In Lebanon, Druze, Sunnis, Shi<span class="s21">c</span>a, Maronite Christians, and Palestinians are included in the MAR dataset. In Egypt, Coptic Christians (but not Sunnis) are considered a minority at risk population. As a result, I am only looking at that set of cases for which minorities are potentially vulnerable and then I examine variation within that set of cases. Birnir et al. (2015) discuss how to extend the Minorities at Risk data to avoid issues of selection bias.</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark328">coercion. The effect size is smallest for religious difference and larger for differences in language and customs. These results suggest that collective punishments are visited most often upon less legible groups.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">The MAR dataset also reports information on group organization for “joint political action,” a variable that proxies for some of the non-compliance behaviors that I have sought to measure in this project. The scale’s low value is the case where there is no political movement or organization which represents group interests (0) whereas the high value on this scale is measured as group interests promoted by militant organizations (5). To what extent is group organization for “joint political action” increasing with higher levels of repression against civilians? While a naive correlational analysis cannot speak to the ways that these two variables endogenously affect each other, it is nonetheless worth reporting that there is a positive and substantively large, statistically significant correlation between these two variables. For a group with no civilian repression, group organization for “joint political action” is predicted to go from promotion of group interests through conventional political parties and movements to a prediction of conventional and militant strategies with high levels of civilian repression.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">An alternative measure of non-compliance worth investigating is rebellious activity. In particular, is rebellious activity associated with repression against civilians? Again, using the MAR data I find that there is a positive, statis- tically significant correlation between repression of civilians and rebellion. With no civilian repression, the predicted probability of rebellion is very low but as civilian repression goes from its lowest level to the highest level, the predicted probability increases to an expectation of terrorism and local rebellions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Toward a More General Understanding of State Repression</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Despite important advancements in the study of repression, Davenport and Inman have argued that scholars know comparatively little about the impact of repression on social and political phenomena.<span class="s19">111 </span>Indeed, researchers have paid more attention to rebel attacks on governments than state repression against those within their territorial jurisdiction.<span class="s19">112</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Davenport and Inman 2012.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Davenport 2007.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">In recent years, scholarly research has focused to a greater extent on puzzles associated with the allocation of government goods and services—distributive politics—than the allocation of government punishments and oppressions— the politics of repression.<span class="s19">113 </span>This has left a number of core puzzles about the politics of repression neglected. Davenport argues that a more elaborate theoretical explanation for why repression takes place would be a welcome contribution to the literature, as well as for the inclusion of the study of repression as a core area of interest to political science rather than as the exclusive domain of studies of law, human rights and political theory.<span class="s19">114 </span>This project has sought to address some of these shortcomings in the literature, and in a way that engages directly with core concepts within the field of comparative politics, including constructivist ideas of identity formation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">See Golden and Min (2013) for a review of the recent literature on distributive politics within the subfield of comparative politics.</p></li><li><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">See Davenport (2007). For example, discussions of collective punishment have mostly existed within the study of international law. Scholars have discussed the conditions under which it might be justified to impose burdens on individuals by virtue of the fact that someone from their group has caused a harm (Pasternak 2011). May (2011) has theorized about the various forms of collective punishment and considers the normative implications of collective punishment.</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark329">BIBLIOGRAPHY </a><a name="bookmark330">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Abdullah, Thabit. 2006. <i>Dictatorship, Imperialism and Chaos: Iraq since 1989</i>.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">London: Zed Books.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ahram, Ariel. 2011. <i>Proxy Warriors: The Rise and Fall of State-Sponsored Militias</i>.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Ahram, Ariel. 2015. “Development, Counterinsurgency and the Destruction of the Iraqi Marshes.” <i>International Journal of Middle East Studies</i>. 47(3): 447–466.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Ahram, Ariel. 2016. “The Rise and Fall of Iraq in the Social Sciences.” <i>Social Science Quarterly</i>. 97(4): 850–861.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Alahmad, Nida. 2009. “State Power in Iraq, 1988–2005.” Doctoral dissertation, New School for Social Research.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">al-Ali, Nadje Sadig. 2007. <i>Iraqi Women: Untold Stories from 1948 to the Present</i>.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">London: Zed Books.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">al-Ali, Zaid. 2014. <i>The Struggle for Iraq’s Future: How Corruption, Incompetence and Sectarianism have Undermined Democracy</i>.
